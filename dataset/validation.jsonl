The leading explanation for the moon's origin, known as the giant impact hypothesis, suggests that the moon resulted from the collision of two protoplanets, or embryonic worlds.

They found that the impact not only created a disk of debris near Earth that formed the moon, but it also ejected huge amounts of rubble — as much as several percent of Earth's mass — away from Earth and the moon.", "The simulations found that numerous fragments from the moon-forming impact — hundreds of millions of which were at least a mile (1.6 kilometers) long — blasted the asteroid belt, striking asteroids there at speeds of more than 22,370 mph (36,000 km/h), more than twice as fast as typical crashes in the belt. These collisions from the moon-forming impact would have generated superheated material, the researchers said.", "\"In an explosion, there is often collateral damage, where nearby buildings and innocent bystanders are affected,\" Bottke said. \"Investigators can learn about the explosive device and the explosion itself by studying what happened to people, infrastructure, and whether trace amounts of the explosive device can be found among the blast damage. Here, the 'innocent bystanders' were the main-belt asteroids.\"", "Collisions against these asteroids in more recent times returned these remnants to Earth in stony meteorites, which the scientists now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact.", "\"In a sense, the asteroid belt has been an eyewitness to multiple 'drive-by shootings' from the earliest time in solar system history,\" Bottke said. \"By reading the traces left behind, we can use asteroid samples to tell us who did it, when they did it and how they did it.\"", "The researchers deduced that the moon-forming impact occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with many previous estimates.", "\"We can now use asteroids, for the first time, to tell us about many of the major events that took place in the inner solar system during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said. \"This gives us a new window on a time period which has been virtually unknown up to now.\"", "This research \"raises the intriguing possibility that trace amounts of the primordial Earth or moon-forming impactor called Theia may still be found on asteroids today, or possibly within some of our meteorites,\" Bottke said. \"It may be simply a matter of looking and asking the right questions.

Here are some rules to follow.", "Rule No. 1: Don’t", "Don’t! Just don’t. Let me say this again for good measure: DON’T.", "I know there’s at least one or two of you out there who are thinking, \"Ha! I am a multitasking god! Your mortal rules can not apply to me.\" You can eat a cheeseburger with your knee as you put on make-up with your elbow and steer the car with your chin, and you’ve done it before. That’s the problem.", "Sponsored", "I tried catching Pokémon while parked in a drive-thru. Even then, I felt dumb when I didn’t move up immediately because there was a Poliwag in sight. Park somewhere where you’ll stay parked to catch Pokémon.", "Pokémon Go requires your full attention. Driving also requires your full attention. Yes, there’s the augmented reality mode, and you can leave that AR feature on to put Pokémon on a backdrop of whatever’s in front of you. Problem is, you’re then focusing on catching the Pokémon instead of the background of reality.", "The little suckers move around in AR mode, too! It’s one thing to walk around your apartment trying to catch a particularly jump-happy Pokémon. It’s much worse to do so while also trying to drive. You can’t easily spin around in the driver’s seat if a Pokémon darts sideways, and it takes an absurd amount of your attention to follow them around anyway.", "So, keep it in park if you’re going to do anything in the game. You can enjoy the comfortable seats, luxurious cupholders and life-sustaining air conditioning of your car’s interior, but don’t play the game itself unless your car is safely parked, and out of the way of other traffic.", "Simply put: \"P\" means \"play.\" Or, if you have a manual transmission, don’t even think about playing until you’ve yanked the parking brake.", "Parked to figure out my next move.", "Rule No. 2: Scope Out Your Next Pokéstop Before Going There", "The great thing about the Pokémon Go interface is that it gives you a map. You can tap on further away gyms and Pokéstops to see where they are before they’re in range, and thus, you can figure out where you’d like to go next without the app distracting you from the task of driving.", "Find a few points of interest, write them down, or put them in your car’s navigation unit. Then drive there! Driving is great. When you park, do so in a safe and legal location. Be sure to follow all applicable traffic and parking laws as you normally would.", "Rule No. 3: Leave Your Phone On, But On Silent And Hidden", "One big downside to the game is that it has to be on and running to work, or to log those brief moments where you’re traveling at low speeds (more on this later). This will drain your battery life fast, according to anyone who’s ever played the game for more than 30 minutes.", "Fortunately, most cars now come with power outlets, so your car is bizarrely well-suited for hunting Pokémon. Once you have your next Pokéstop determined, plug your phone in, throw it on silent, and forget about it until your next stop. Then you’ll pull up with a fully recharged phone with more than enough battery life to stuff your next gym full of Magikarp.", "http://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-pla...", "How to leave your phone hidden while charging, as illustrated in a Porsche 918 Spyder.", "If you’re the kind of person who is tempted by phone sounds, hide it in a cubbyhole. Out of sight, out of mind. If you know you’ll still somehow hear it vibrate, turn off that function as well. If you really have no self-control, stick your phone in the trunk.", "I will say that my fear of becoming That Guy who mowed down an entire median full of ornamental shrubberies while playing Pokémon Go has made me a less distracted driver. With the game on, gone is my temptation to glance down at text messages at stop lights. I simply don’t want to interrupt the game or get caught using it behind the wheel.", "One of many landmarks you’ll find as Pokéstops in the game.", "Rule No. 4: Get Out And Walk Around Anyway", "I’m always looking for shortcuts. So, naturally, the idea of tossing my phone in the trunk to run a few errands—or laps on a race track—to hatch an egg sounded like a solid plan.", "Nope. The app was one step ahead of that idea. After my roughly 48-kilometer drive to test this idea barely netted any km towards egg hatching, I wondered what was up.", "Turns out, there’s a speed limit on what the game will log in terms of distance traveled. While I couldn’t find the limit published on any official channels, one unofficial source on Quora claimed the app is limited to 20 kph—which sounds about right.", "Because you have to drive safely, we don’t recommend puttering around at speeds slower than 20 kph on public roads. That’s only about 12 mph for those of us not fully dedicated to the metric system. 12! You would blow the fuse in your horn if you got stuck behind some jamoke doing 12 mph on a public road.", "It’s still worth having the app on and hidden in your car as it will still log that brief bit of travel under 12 mph, but don’t expect it to hatch eggs much faster. There are better ways to cheat this, after all, some of which even involve the use of remote-control cars.", "If you’re playing around cars, make sure they’re going to stay parked for a while. Inside Petrol Lounge, Austin.", "Rather, do what the game wants you to do: get out and explore. See your city’s landmarks. If you have an egg to hatch, drive to a park that has a few stops in it.", "Pick Pokéstops that coincide with other errands you have to do. My usual coffee shop, for example, is next door to a gym. That’s convenient! I’m out of my car anyway and it’s a place I don’t mind hanging out for a little while.", "Once you’re at a stop and have caught all the new Pokémon you can, you can start the process all over again: pick a new Pokéstop or gym to drive to based on the options available, toss your silent phone on a charger out of reach, and have at it."], "targetTitle": "How To Play Pokémon Go In Your Car Without Mowing Down Trees Or People", "targetDescription": "Let’s get this out of the way: Pokémon Go is meant for walking.

{"uuid": "8b713277-0e5b-4873-a216-b650f21f3b4c", "postId": "389091583213453312", "postText": ["\"Harry Potter\" alums reunite for new movie"], "postPlatform": "Twitter", "targetParagraphs": ["The mythology of punk music's evolution can be traced back, more or less, to one singular staple: CBGB. Opened in 1973 in downtown Manhattan's East Village, the nightclub that originally intended to house country, bluegrass and blues music (hint its acronym) quickly became a breeding ground for bands like The Ramones, Talking Heads and The Police, among countless others.", "The legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars Alan Rickman as bemused owner Hilly Kristal. It's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in \"Harry Potter\" or Judge Turpin in \"Sweeney Todd.\" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly's daughter Lisa.", "HuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. Plus, Grint talks about his own punk phase and Rickman explains what Halloween used to mean for him.", "What are you up to today?", "Rickman: I'm in New York. I'm just here for three or four days for \"CBGB\" in New York and then back to work in England.", "Grint: I'm rehearsing a play that will start [in London] in a couple of weeks. Yeah, so that's it.", "Are you enjoying the theater work? Are you more of a theater guy or a film guy?", "Grint: I don’t know, really. This is my first theater experience, and it’s very different. I wanted to just try it; it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. Just the thought of it scares me. I’ve kind of put it off for a long time, and I just thought it was a good time to do it. And it’s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, I’m enjoying it.", "Were you familiar with the legacy of CBGB as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie?", "Rickman: I wasn’t familiar with CBGB at all. I didn’t know about it and didn’t know its history. I hadn’t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time I was very much in England as a drama student and an art student, so it’s all been a new discovery to me. Obviously I was aware of some of the bands, but not that they’d all started in a club on the Bowery.", "Grint: I didn't actually know a lot about it. I'd obviously heard of the name and the logo and seen it on T-shirts and stuff like that, but I didn’t really know how prolific it was in discovering some of my favorite bands. I love Talking Heads, and the whole punk thing was something I really loved. So, yeah, it was quite an education learning about it. And also Dead Boys, I wasn’t really familiar with them, and kind of listening and watching them on YouTube was amazing. They just had so much energy, and they were just disgusting. It was incredible.", "Did you grow up listening to the music depicted in the movie?", "Rickman: Obviously I was aware of the huge rise of The Police in England, and as an art student I was very much a fan of Talking Heads. And then Blondie, but I wasn’t a hard punk-rock fan at the time. But of course I was also very much around the height of The Beatles and The Stones, so it was like that was the lone star and everything spun off from there. And [Bob] Dylan, very much so. ... England in the ‘60s and the ‘70s was everything that history has said; it was phenomenally exciting, musically. One was very shaped by that.", "Grint: It was that whole era that I liked. I like, obviously, The Sex Pistols and The Clash, Blondie as well, and The Ramones. Some amazing people performed on that stage. ... I went through a real punk phase not that long ago, and yeah, it was probably the reason why I decided to do it, because I have such a love for that.", "Did you dress similarly to the character that you play at any point?", "Grint: [Laughs] No, not at all. The dog collar was a new experience for me.", "Not knowing much of the mythology of CBGB, how did you come to learn about your characters?", "Rickman: What I really enjoyed and what made it interesting to play was the fact that he happened in direct contrast to the world of the club and what its history became. Because there was this big quiet, contained man who made a club for country music and it never ever played there. Along came punk, and he became like that deus ex machina, I suppose. I watched old interviews and DVDs. I listened to him talking to his mother and his daughter and journalists, so there was a lot of material for me.", "Grint: Yeah, there wasn’t really a whole lot to go on. There are a few videos of him playing live at CBGB and a few interviews I watched. Yeah, and having [Dead Boys guitarist Cheetah Chrome] on set was quite a different thing. I had kind of a little bit of pressure because he was kind of watching every scene, and you’re trying to portray him and do him justice, and it’s quite a challenge.", "So he was on set the whole time?", "Grint: Yeah, he has a cameo. He plays the cab driver. He was lovely. He was such a nice guy. I was kind of surprised he was still alive.", "Did he give you any notes while filming?", "Grint: Not so much notes. It was just kind of watching him and being around him and listening to his stories and just listening, really, kind of absorbing a lot of that. And he was such a nice guy and we had a good time.", "Was this movie your first instance of nudity on camera?", "Grint: Yeah, I guess it was, yeah.", "Were you comfortable with that? How did that go down?", "Grint: Weirdly, yeah. It didn’t really feel that big a deal. It just kind of happened. I didn’t really think about it when I was getting ready for it, and yeah, it just kind of happened. I had some sort of sock, modesty thing, contraption. I don’t want to go into too much detail. And yeah, it was just sort of one of those things. There was quite a lot of that in the film. Especially from Justin [Bartha] as well. ... There’s quite a lot of ass in the film.", "You had to try out an American accent in this role. Is there an accent out there that you'd be intimidated to have to use on camera?", "Rickman: I think every English actor is nervous of a Newcastle accent. That’s really difficult.", "Grint: It’s quite fun just trying to work on it and get it right. I like that kind of challenge. A couple years ago, I did a film that required me to do a Liverpool accent. I don’t know if you’re familiar with that sound, but that was quite a hard one. It’s quite a harsh sound. But I enjoy that side of things.", "Once you started exploring the role and got into The Dead Boys and their history, did you find yourself enjoying their music? What did you think of the band you were portraying?", "Grint: I really love them. I listened to all their songs completely. Their songs are quite hard to play, not easy to listen to. But no, I really love then. I’ve always really wanted to be in a band, so this was kind of an opportunity to experience that. To go on stage and have the whole crowd there and the music.", "Is music something you’d ever pursue?", "Grint: I don’t know, probably not. I’ve tried to leverage it, but I just know it’s never going to happen.", "Alan, you often play very dominant roles, very powerful people. What were your thoughts going into a character who was much more loose-goosey? Is it fun to shift gears and play that sort of character?", "Rickman: I suppose, in my perspective, I’ve played as many of those as I have the other sort. It’s just some get more publicity or make more money at the box office or something. I’m perfectly happy to be Colonel Brandon in \"Sense & Sensibility\" as I am any of those powerful characters. It’s just part of an actor’s job, and you just alter the colors that you get out of the cupboard.", "How was it to reunite? Had you seen each other since doing press for the eighth \"Harry Potter\" movie?", "Rickman: No, because I think we’d both been so busy doing other things. But it was great to see him on the set, and it was great to watch all three of them. I saw Emma [Watson] the other night in London in a restaurant, and I saw Daniel [Radcliffe] recently in London because he was doing a play. It’s great to watch the three of them moving forward into the rest of their lives and being working actors and not trapped by one image.", "Grint: Not really, no, actually. ... I love Alan. He’s always been one of my favorites. But yeah, it was quite weird seeing him in a whole new kind of environment because -- I’m trying to think back -- I don’t think I ever really saw him outside of that wig and cloak.", "Which \"Potter\" co-star would you most like to reunite with?", "Grint: There are so many. All of them. I’ve already loved working with them. I like Michael Gambon. He’s so cool; just a remarkable guy. I’ve worked with Julie Walters before as well. I love her, she’s great.", "Now for something more fun. It's October. What's your favorite Halloween costume you've ever worn?", "Rickman: [Laughs] The thing about Halloween is, to me, it just means -- because it’s so different in England –- we used to have something called Bonfire Night, and we’d have fireworks. That’s disappeared and I know Halloween’s taken over. Halloween to me as a child was, the family would fill a bowl of water and you’d have apple bobbing in it, and you’d get apples out of a bowl of water. To me it just means a soaking wet shirt.", "Grint: I liked Halloween. It never used to be a big thing when I was kid. We never really did it. But I actually had a good costume not that long ago. The last one, I dressed as a Play-Doh can that I made. You know Play-Doh?", "Of course.", "Grint: Well, literally, I actually made it. It was a yellow bin. I cut the bottom out and I just wore a yellow bin with a Play-Doh logo. With a yellow hat. It’s not very practical.", "Do you have a favorite Halloween candy?", "Rickman: I don’t even know what that means. The word \"chocolate\" would loom large.", "Grint: A favorite Halloween candy? I don’t really know. I never trick-or-treated when I was younger because we lived on a block of houses that were all just kind of elderly people who were just scared to answer the door. But yeah, candy corn, that’s a big thing. I’ve tried that.

This is known as thermogenesis.", "However, certain foods use up more energy and create more heat as the body 'burns' calories.

In our bodies, white fat cells store energy and brown fat cells are thermogenic, producing heat by burning fat.", "A 2015 study suggested that increasing capsaicin in the diet may stimulate thermogenesis and also induce white fat cells to behave like thermogenic brown fat cells.", "Use fresh chilis, chilli flakes or cayenne powder to add flavour to marinades and dressings or simply sprinkle liberally on your meals.", "2. WHOLE GRAINS AND VEGETABLES", "Complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, oats and quinoa (also high in protein), are high in dietary fibre that the gut cannot fully digest and break down.", "The extra effort the body has to put in requires extra energy, burning its energy stores to digest these indigestible foods.", "It is no surprise that any weight loss programme will encourage eating high portions of vegetables, and in particular the leafy greens such as spinach, rocket, watercress, kale and cabbage.", "These vegetables are all high in insoluble fibre.

Choose fruits with high fibre content, such as apples or pears.", "3. BLACK PEPPER", "Piperine, a compound found in black pepper, has a thermic effect and can be responsible for the breakdown of some fat cells.", "So, reaching for the black pepper not only offers the benefits of its thermic effect but also adds extra flavour to your meal.", "4. GINGER", "Ginger also contains capsaicin, responsible for its fiery flavour. Eating ginger, fresh or powdered, in your food can speed up the metabolism due to the increased heat production.", "Studies also suggest that ginger can reduce feelings of hunger and may help to manage weight.

GARLIC", "Like ginger, garlic - with its fiery kick - contains compounds that can enhance thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Use extra cloves if you enjoy the taste and include in marinades and dressings for a flavour boost.", "6. MUSTARD", "Mustard contains compounds found in other spicy foods, and in particular capsaicin, that not only gives it its characteristic flavour but also can also help to increase the body temperature when eaten.", "Add in a teaspoon of mustard to your salad dressing or include it in a casserole for added flavour.", "7. GREEN TEA", "Studies show that both caffeine and catechin polyphenols - micronutrients - found in green tea can help to stimulate the metabolism, boosting the number of calories used by the body.", "Therefore, it can promote weight loss, when combined with a healthy balanced diet and increased physical activity.", "8. PROTEIN", "When compared to fats and carbohydrates, eating a meal high in protein has a bigger thermic effect.

Are you thinking sketchy FSB agents? Passing urine samples back and forth through a hole in a wall ... hidden behind a cabinet in a laboratory? And everything kinda sorta maybe ties back to Putin? Because then you’d be absolutely right.", "This morning, the Court of Arbitration for Sport made a ruling on Russia’s cartoonish state-sponsored skullduggery, which has been going on since 2010: It upheld the International Association of Athletic Federations’ ban on Russian track and field athletes in the Rio Olympics, whether there’s hard evidence they were juicing or not. The International Olympics Committee is still making up its mind about that ban, but it’s also still possible it will ban the country altogether—a decision that would affect not just the medal counts in Rio, but the state of international athletics.", "Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, builds models that forecast medal counts based on past performance, population, GDP, and other variables. In London, the Russians won four to 16 more medals than his models predicted—meaning their wins were probably inflated by doping. And his numbers have been borne out: The Olympic committee has since reallocated 11 Russian medals from the London games.", "If the Russians competed in Rio cleanly (or, as Noland says, \"no dirtier than average\"), his models suggest they’re good for 66 or 67 medals. So how many more would he expect if doping went on unchecked? If they managed to nab 11 extra medals in London, when their doping program was still relatively new, you can bet they could get at least that number and then some. Noland figures the Russians would have come away with about 80 medals.", "If the IOC does ban Russia, that’s enough medals to throw any Olympic predictions seriously out of whack. And many of the medals that might have otherwise gone to Russian athletes would likely go to competitors from the US, as they did at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics that the Soviet Union boycotted: In the absence of the USSR, the US’s total medal count skyrocketed to 174, and fell to 94 when the Soviets returned to the Olympics in 1988. \"For the Olympic movement, it’s a huge deal,\" says David Wallechinsky, the President of the International Society of Olympic Historians. \"This isn’t Tonga or Paraguay, it’s one of three big medal winners.\"", "For the average American Olympics viewer, the absence of Russian athletes might go unnoticed. Where it most certainly will be noticed, of course, is Russia. \"You cannot separate the Olympics from politics,\" says Wallechinsky. \"That’s a myth. Russia is already saying this a Western plot.\" Countries have been banned from the Olympics before, but it’s always been for overtly political reasons. Germany and Japan were not on the Olympic guest list for the 1948 Summer Olympics, South Africa was banned during the apartheid era, and Afghanistan was banned in 2000.", "The potential Russian ban wouldn’t be that much of a departure from those decisions, because Olympic athletes’ doping is inherently political. \"If doping is done for the glory of the nation state, even if the athlete is doing it in secret with just an Internet connection and a PO box, it can take on an element of politics,\" says John Gleaves, co-director of the International Network of Humanistic Doping Research. And state-sponsored doping is the same, but, you know, more so.", "One of the reasons that doping has remained such a problem at the Olympics is that the whole process is completely byzantine, and countries are left to police themselves. \"The anti-doping setup had led to a really lumpy enforcement,\" says Gleaves. \"How much anti-doping work can Kenya be expected to do when you look at its ranking in GDP?\" The Russian doping scandal puts a spotlight on a problem that was already systemic in international sports.", "Which may very well drive the IOC to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. \"The IOC is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport—and failed on all those accounts,\" says The Games: A Global History of the Olympics .

He puts on his best John Goodman: \"‘I’m talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.'\"", "And this scandal seems an appropriate place for the IOC to draw that line. Look at what happened to East German athletes in the 1970s. \"At the nadir, doping accounted for 17 percent of the medals won in women’s competitions,\" says Noland. \"There was no informed consent. You now have high rates of birth defects amongst East German athletes. The stuff they gave them had incredible, multi-generational physiological damage. I regard this as really evil.\" Whether you think that doping is inherently bad or the future of athletic excellence, state-sponsored doping is not in the spirit of the games."], "targetTitle": "What Would Happen if the Olympics Banned Russia?", "targetDescription": "Because the Olympics are always political, and state-sponsored doping sure is too.", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://archive.is/kvX42/a0d35dcc1f144f724e533c02322ad2f1f84ed0db.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/8e2fba476fa12929c8e57044fd4224862cc659b8.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/6cb066f3cc322055fbc027674f9093504fe0841d.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/d80edde401b0404a95987e46c6ae800d6ddd686f.png", "http://archive.is/kvX42/4450fbb86cdb5cc9b9cf12bb16399f3ae95ec19b.png", "http://archive.is/kvX42/ce85099bf875533ca2a7a57869e643f88314dc50.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/0dabde7bde542821d340f80f75981c23f4a385b2.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/c4f66ffcaa2014b1c730fbf1b1bdd0c921ee39d9.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/a28dd3ac060157e2d7d11d047e8bee875d073742/scr.png", "http://archive.is/kvX42/dae257cd8abc7aa725392bbe6006c78f3601aea6.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,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", "http://archive.is/kvX42/4f745675ee7f667b2fcc685e94b288330a1d21eb.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/c8728df74487f907230358a1b08ae1a1b25f9ed4.png", "http://archive.is/kvX42/79a5c6689b557efb5f61308f3a145434bec6dea3.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/ebd66de2ae8b9ab064e7f62c12c4b4198ae86313.png", "data:image/png;base64,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", "http://archive.is/kvX42/54600d504feaafcf6a9810f8f602532429a2c023.jpg", "http://archive.is/kvX42/f12f9f28bfaeb4b412e823400d68f1c99664ccdd.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "http://archive.is/kvX42/113c05fcfb6492c0d9262e1042490ed0a494eec1.jpg"], "targetUrl": "http://archive.is/kvX42", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "The U.S. athletes would win more medals.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["enough medals to throw any Olympic predictions seriously out of whack.

Sending money to every single citizen is expensive, so most UBI proposals involve some limits on who is eligible for the money — minors and the already-wealthy, for instance, might get smaller checks. Limits aside, the general point remains the same: (Almost) everyone gets a check from the government to spend without restrictions.", "Why is it popular?", "The basic concept has intellectual roots dating back to at least the 18th century .

A recent Oxford University study found that as many as 47% percent of jobs are at risk of being computerized (although another study found that number may be as low as 9%).", "Is anyone getting paid yet?", "No nation has implemented a universal basic income, but the idea has gained traction in a few countries. Sweden recently voted down an initiative that would have implemented a relatively generous basic income for adults on top of the country’s existing social services, Britain’s labor party is considering advocating for a basic income, Finland may implement a version of UBI next year, and a city in the Netherlands is also pursuing a basic income experiment .", "Y Combinator’s Krisiloff says the newfound discussion of a basic income represents a fresh attitude towards government welfare programs. \"I think part of the reason it’s back in vogue is because people are more accepting of unconditional programs,\" he says. \"People are starting to think there are more cost effective, less paternalistic, hands-on ways to help.\""], "targetTitle": "Why this tech company is giving 100

I had more parents in my office than ever before.\"", "It was new territory for Retzlaff, then principal of the school in Webster Groves, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, but it was never a question of whether she would or wouldn’t open the bathroom.", "And as time passed, the calls slowly began to subside, going from once a day, to once a week, to once a month. ", "That was more than two years ago – a blip in the schoolwide effort to help the soon-to-be third-grader transition as seamlessly as possible from female to male – yet still no cohesive policy exists nationwide on the issue of bathroom access for transgender students. ", "Even before controversy erupted earlier this year over new state laws limiting transgender rights, or this month’s deadly mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, many schools across the country had taken proactive steps to make the school environment safer and more welcoming to transgender students.", "Opponents of policies that accommodate the bathroom needs of transgender students have argued that it’s an issue of safety for non-transgender students.", "In reality, however, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students face the greater risk of harassment and assault, especially transgender students, and supporters say the bathroom discussion should be focused on protecting their safety. ", "According to FBI statistics, more than 20 percent of reported hate crimes were attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity – second only to race, and more than attacks based on religious bias.", "Although some state attorneys general and legislators have taken the federal government to court over its directive instructing all public school districts to allow transgender students to use restrooms that match their gender identity, school districts in those very states have quietly dealt with the issue with relative ease. ", "And students, rather than state officials or school administrators, are often at the forefront in pushing for the change.", "Eliza Byard, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, a New York-based organization that supports LGBT-inclusive policies for teachers and students, said school leaders and students live with the issue and understand it better than elected officials do.", "\"If they were listening to local authorities,\" she said, \"they’d get out of the way.\"", "Atherton High School in Louisville, Kentucky, has had a policy in place for two years that allows transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, and Principal Thomas Aberli says there have been no problems. ", "\"The most recent federal guidelines are aligned with what we’ve been doing for the past two years,\" Aberli said in an interview.", "Despite some concerns that permitting transgender students to use the appropriate bathroom might threaten the safety and privacy of other students, Aberli said that hasn’t happened at Atherton.", "\"We have several transgender students now,\" he said. \"It’s just kind of a non-issue.\"", "In March, Springfield Central High School in Massachusetts converted two single-user faculty bathrooms into two gender-neutral bathrooms, one each for faculty and students. Principal Thaddeus Tokarz said transgender students aren’t required to use it, though some choose to do so.", "\"I believe we make it a point to have them use the bathroom they feel most comfortable with,\" Tokarz said.", "In Camas, Wash., across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore., Liberty Middle School Principal Marilyn Boerke said she was prepared for an onslaught of complaints from parents in the conservative district when the school adopted its policy in 2014, \"but it just didn’t happen.\" ", "The 770-student school allows its five or so transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Only two parents objected, Boerke said.", "In response, Boerke told those parents that if their children were uncomfortable sharing a restroom with a trans student, they could opt to use another. ", "\"Part of that could be how our community at Liberty is really all about family,\" she said. \"We just don’t accept that kind of intolerance.\"", "But the backlash is only beginning elsewhere.", "In Texas, Lt. Gov Dan Patrick has demanded the resignation of Kent Scribner, Fort Worth’s school superintendent, over the district’s transgender-inclusive bathroom policy. Patrick also argued for its repeal, calling it \"social engineering.\"", "Texas is leading a multistate lawsuit in federal court against the Obama administration’s policy. ", "Last month, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Justice Department told schools across the country that Title IX of a 1972 federal education law protects transgender students from discrimination based on sex, including the use of bathrooms, locker rooms and showering facilities.", "The department reminded schools that those that did not comply with Title IX requirements risked losing federal funds. ", "In a Virginia case, a federal court agreed with the federal government and sided with a transgender student who challenged his school’s policy that forces him to a bathroom that does not match his gender identity. ", "Nevertheless, Texas and 10 other states sued the Obama administration last month, with Mississippi, Kentucky and Kansas later joining the effort.", "This month, the Kansas Board of Education voted unanimously to oppose the Obama administration’s policy, though the board will allow school districts to continue policies that accommodate transgender students.", "According to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network’s 2013 School Climate Survey, transgender and gender-nonconforming students faced more hostility than lesbian, gay or bisexual students did.", "Four in 10 said they felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression. About half reported being verbally harassed, and about 1 in 5 reported being physically assaulted.", "The majority of students surveyed said they didn’t report the harassment or assault to school officials because of doubt the staff would do anything about it or fear that it could make things worse.", "Some schools that have accommodated transgender students say the move has improved the learning environment.", "\"This was probably the best decision we made as a school all year,\" said Kevin Biggs, principal of Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa.", "Although he said students were always able to use the most appropriate bathroom for their needs, Biggs said a student visited him in November and explained that some transgender students didn’t feel comfortable using the bathrooms that were available. ", "The school created two \"all-gender,\" single-stall restrooms in February. Students can still choose what works best for them.", "\"Those little things make a huge difference in a student’s day", "they’re distractions that can keep students from learning to their highest possible potential,\" Biggs said. \"We wanted to make that possible.\" ", "Student Alonzo Hernandez, 16, helped kick-start the process of creating a multi-stalled gender-neutral bathroom at the Santee Education Complex, a high school in Los Angeles, where he is a junior. ", "Hernandez is in transition from female to male, and his effort was driven, in part, by his own discomfort in using the school’s existing bathrooms. He’d sometimes avoid going to the bathroom the whole day to avoid harassment.", "\"There’d be times when I would personally wait in the stall to make sure everyone in the bathroom was cleared out so I could come out of the stall,\" he said in an interview.", "The concerns weren’t unfounded.

And by December 2012, I was up to $5,700 that month. The month I paid off my student loans, July of 2013, I earned $11,000 that month.", "How exactly does the blog bring in money?", "Now, I'm making money in much different ways from just a few years ago. Before I was making money from sponsored posts and by writing for other blogs, and now the majority is through affiliate marketing   $50,000 a month is from that, and that's the bulk of my income. There are 15-20 companies I actively promote on my social media and blog platform.", "The other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course, in which I teach other bloggers how to create affiliate income. In November 2016, that accounted for $38,000 of my income. I created that because I had so many bloggers email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings. Now it's more a form of passive income, since I already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instructions and lessons are already done.", "My third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising. In those instances, maybe I partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling. Or I participate in a Twitter chat with the company, or they do some kind of advertisement on my social media platforms.", "Why did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016?", "In 2015, I decided to stop doing all my freelancing. I stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business. I was nervous to get rid of all my clients, but I realized I truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others.", "By focusing on my business, I was finally able to find ways to diversify my income, improve my blog, increase my traffic, and come up with extra ideas for my blog, such as the course, which now accounts for a big chunk of my income   20%-30%.", "I also was able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic, which directly relates to making more money blogging as well. It only took me a few months after I dropped all those clients to start seeing the jump in my income.", "I was making $12,000-$15,000 monthly when I decided I was going to focus just on my own business, then I made a jump to the $20,000-$30,000 range, and it just kept going to $40,000, then $50,000, to where I am now at $100,000.", "How has your changing income changed your lifestyle?", "As a full-time blogger I have a flexible schedule and am my own boss and now travel full-time. My husband, who used to be a new car salesman, quit his day job at the same time I quit mine in October 2013 when I was making $10,000 a month from the blog   and now works on the blog too. At the time, we were making more from our day jobs put together than from the blog, but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full-time.", "The main lifestyle change is that we live in an RV, are location-independent and work wherever we can. We sold our house in Missouri in July 2015 and now we work from wherever.", "Why did you start living in an RV?", "My husband has always wanted to live in an RV, and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an RV. There's always a joke in the RV community that there's always one person who wants to do it and then the other person has to spend years convincing the other person to do it.  That's pretty much how it was.", "But I stepped into an RV one day   we just decided to look at one   and I loved being in it. So we decided to give RVing a shot. It was just going to be a weekend thing to see family or do short weekend or week trips, but we came to love it and never went home. We would be gone for a month or two at a time, so we just decided to turn the RV thing into a full-time venture and haven't looked back since.", "How big was your house? ", "We had a finished basement, and so if you count that, 2,500 square feet. If you don't, it was 1,200 square feet with three bedrooms.", "How big is the RV?", "It's 400 square feet if you include all the slides being out.", "Did you have to get rid of a lot of stuff?", "Yes, the Salvation Army came and took a bunch of stuff, and we rented a dumpster to collect broken appliances and junk and we had neighbors come and just take whatever they wanted for free. We kept clothing and photo albums.", "How does living in an RV make your finances different from other people's?", "It doesn't really change. Our RV cost more than our house, but RVing can be as cheap or expensive as you want it to be   just like with a normal home. There are cheap RVs, and there are RVs worth millions of dollars. It's comparable to living in a home, but I have a different view all the time. There are free places to stay, but we mainly choose private campgrounds or state parks that cost money.", "We usually stay in one place for a month. We like to follow the weather, so we like to stay in a forever 70-degree weather area, and we like to follow activities we like such as riding our bikes outside and going for a hike, so 70-degree weather is what we're looking for all year long.", "How has all this newfound wealth changed you?", "I'm not as stressed about money as I was just a few years ago. But I'm just as frugal as before. It's not below me to use a coupon. I just don't like to be wasteful. If there's a way to save money, I'm not going to waste time to find ways to save money, but if a money saver is there, I'll go for it.", "How has your wealth changed your relationships?", "It really hasn't changed them too much. We're often told that people are surprised we're the same and that you would expect people making $100,000 a month to not be as nice or down to earth. But many of our friends still call us down-to-earth.", "How was money handled when you were growing up and what habits or attitudes did you carry into adulthood? ", "My mom wasn't super good with money, but my dad was better, so I learned what to do from him. He taught me how to live within my budget and also how to use a credit card correctly. A lot of people think credit cards are the root of all evil, but you can use them to build your credit score and you can earn rewards points with them.", "I'm still very frugal. I don't pay for any form of TV, I don't have cable, Netflix, Hulu or anything like that. We haven't spent any money on TV since February 2015 to save money and also to not spend as much time watching TV. I feel like there's plenty of things to watch on local channels. If I had any more channels, I'd be in front of the TV all day long.", "How much time do you spend on your blog?", "Between 40 and 60 hours a week. I work longer hours when I'm trying to get far ahead in my blog content. I currently do three blog posts a week.", "Do you have help?", "I do have an editor who edits my site and a tech person to make sure my site is always up and live and no one is hacking it.", "What do you do with your extra income? ", "We invest a lot in Vanguard funds and are saving for retirement one day. By next year, we should have plenty of money to retire early if we chose too. But I still love blogging, so I don't see that ending anytime soon.", "For the next few years, we plan on RVing here and in Canada, and then afterward sailing full-time and go to other countries. I'd have to find ways to manage my internet access. But we do know many bloggers who blog full-time and sail, so it's not impossible."], "targetTitle": "How This 27-Year-Old Made $1 Million Last Year", "targetDescription": "Four years ago, Michelle Schroeder-Gardner was almost $40,000 in debt.

But with the number of Sean Bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show Legends, maybe it’s time to put the many demises into perspective.", "Start looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times.

So where does Sean Bean fall along this list?", "I crafted the following chart to find out:", "Click to enlarge!*", "It looks like the \"walking spoiler\" meme has a grain of truth to it. While Bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them — almost a third of his films.", "However, even though Bean has perfected his \"I’m dying\" face, he still hasn’t died the most on screen. Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies.", "But the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt.

For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park‘s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths/episode.)", "Of course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt).

If anything, it strengthened it. About six weeks later, Jackson proposed to Jeanie Buss. His knees and hips were too stiff to get down on one knee. Not that he is the grand gesture type, anyway. What was important is that he knew getting engaged would make her happy, and give her father some peace as he lay dying.", "The engagement was almost destined to stay at that level once Jackson became president of the Knicks in 2014.

He’s the CEO and founder of SunShare, a company that installs community gardens of solar panels so even those unable to have a solar panel on their roof can access solar power. One word to describe how he sees the energy industry of the future is \"choice.\"", "\"What we’re starting to see is this shift toward consumer preferences actually being an important factor in this industry for the first time,\" says David. \"It’s as simple as the product we’re bringing to customers, which is giving people the power to choose where they want to get their energy.\"", "SunShare started in Colorado with a two-acre project, and has now spread to Minnesota and New York. The gardens range in size from one megawatt to five megawatts, and cover between six and 30 acres of land. Local utility companies purchase energy from the solar garden, and then community members subscribe to the solar garden and receive solar credits on their utility bill.", "\"We think we can change the energy industry because demand for a type of power has never really driven the electricity industry in this country. What you had was more supply side determinations based on regulatory processes and monopoly utilities,\" says David. \"Our hypothesis and what we’ve proven is that people will change, and people making choices with their pocketbooks drives change. Solar energy is beating the costs of natural gas plants across the country right now, even the operating costs, and that’s not even including the volatility premium you’d have to price in to a natural gas plant you’d be building for 20 years. You’ve got the economic plus the environmental benefits that really make solar a win-win for both utilities and consumers.\"", "Yet change is not always easy, and David has had to work against systems that have been in place for a century as he pioneers a new way of providing power.", "\"The challenges are working with utilities that aren’t really built for this new operating system that comes with the renewable and distributed energy infrastructure, so having solar and wind farms around the country near the source of where people are consuming energy. That’s not how this country has looked at consuming energy previously. You’re basically going from one of those old DOS operating systems to Windows XP. It’s a completely different experience,\" he says. \"That’s really what we’re talking about in terms of the difference in how energy is transferred across the grid, managed across the grid, consumed across the grid, and tracked across the grid. It’s that much of a difference. So you’re working with this industry that’s built on a DOS platform with DOS economics. Changing that mindset is probably one of the biggest challenges, but economics are driving that; it’s a powerful force.\"", "As he pursues making solar power affordable and available, he’s at a unique vantage point to predict how the energy industry will ultimately change. In addition to the choices available to people, David predicts it will be easier for utility companies to monitor their energy output.", "\"I think you’re going to be able to track energy usage so that you can much more closely match energy production to energy demand. Previously power plants might be operating consistently 24 hours a day because they really can’t be shut off. You can’t just turn off a coal-fired power plant for four hours in a day. You end up burning a lot more energy, a lot more coal, for example, at nighttime than is actually being used on the system,\" he says. \"So you’ll see a lot less waste in the system, which overall will significantly reduce our energy consumption as a country.\"", "Energy of the future will also be more reliable and secure. \"It’s going to be terrorist-proof: you’re not going to have single points of weakness on the system where terrorists can disrupt our access to electricity. By that, I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid that don’t fail with natural disasters or terrorism,\" says David."], "targetTitle": "What Will Make The Future Of Energy Terrorist-Proof?", "targetDescription": null, "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/methane-burn-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/UNEMPLOYED-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/Terrorist.jpg", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/1339818-oil-anniversary-slide-07-1-424x282.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/1339818-oil-anniversary-slide-07-1-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/09/6089_grande-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/UNEMPLOYED-424x282.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/exxonnmobil-02-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/01/TheSurge_small.png?x15124", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/591fb988757c3c376698a78b35d9193d?s=75&d=http%3A%2F%2Fthesurge.com%2Fapp%2Fthemes%2Fabsolute%2Fimages%2Favatar.png&r=g", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/SunShare_AUG_4_2015-35-1024x683.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/08/WestTexasUpdate-Option2-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/02/exxonnmobil-02-424x282.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/sunshare-portraits-2773-788x1024.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/01/SquareLogo-White473x200-1.png?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2017/01/Daily-Surge-2-1-180x122.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/02/Terrorist-200x200.jpg?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/12/bpships-180x122.png?x15124", "http://thesurge.com/app/uploads/2016/12/bpships-424x282.png?x15124"], "targetUrl": "http://thesurge.com/stories/what-will-make-the-future-of-energy-terrorist-proof", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Diversified energy sources reduces the chance of a total attack on power supply, as opposed to a singular source. #StopClickBait", "spoilerPublisher": "Stop Clickbait - Science"}, "spoiler": ["I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid"], "spoilerPositions": [[[8, 225], [8, 302]]], "tags": ["passage"]}

This focus might be helping Trump, since Solomon’s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him.

One group was asked to write down what they thought would happen, in as much detail as possible, if immigrants moved into their neighborhoods, and what emotions they would feel. The other two groups were asked to answer the same questions, but about their own deaths and about feeling intense pain instead of about immigration.", "Then the two researchers gave the participants a set of words with letters missing and asked them to fill in the blanks to get an idea of what the participants were thinking about.

If they were thinking about death, however, they might write \"COFFIN\" instead.", "The participants who had been asked to think about immigration had death on their minds, too — almost to the same extent as those who had been asked to think about death explicitly.", "Assigned scores from zero to one based on how many words related to death they produced, those who had been asked to think about immigration scored 0.92 on average, while those who had been asked to think about death scored 0.96. Those asked to think about pain scored just 0.19. There was no evidence that the effect was greater for conservative participants in the study.", "Solomon said he hopes to replicate the study, which was completed with a small group of a few dozen students at the College of Staten Island.", "Yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence.

I say this with objectivity as a chef, and would like to think that this overrides any bias that my Greek heritage holds. In Greece it is said that the best of Greek olive oils come from the Peloponnese. For years I have wished that Greeks would be more like the Italians. The Italians do a fantastic job of exporting and promoting their products to other countries. With the booming introduction of Greek yogurt into the U.S., I'm hoping that Greek olive oil will soon follow suit. George Papageorgiou is trying to make that happen.", "The Esti olive grove in Kalamata is located in a beautiful sunlit valley. The grove of mature olive trees look as if they belong in Greek mythology. The olives must be harvested at a specific time during the ripening process. Like Goldilocks searching amongst the belongings of the three bears, George is in constant search for the olives that are \"just right.\" If the olives are too green the olive oil produced will taste bitter. If the olives are too black, the quality of the olive oil will be lost. It's a constant balancing act.", "As we headed into the olive grove, numerous fine mesh nets were being laid down to gather and catch all the olives. Workers set up ladders to reach the tall branches. The lower hanging branches were gently being shaken, taking care not to wound the trees. I began to collect olives in my little basket. As my hands turned a reddish-brown, I reminisced about the days I used to spend as a child, collecting olives with my yiayia.", "We took the gathered olives back to the production plant where George had them ground into paste using large millstones. \"This,\" he explained \"is the traditional method used for making olive oil.\" After grinding, the paste then gets slowly stirred in a separate container for 20 to 40 minutes. This is a process known as malaxation. With malaxation the slow churning action allows the small droplets of oil that were released in the milling process to aggregate, forming large droplets of oil which facilitates mechanical extraction. I was a bit overwhelmed during the whole process. I looked around the manufacturing facility, much like a child the first time they visit Disneyland. I snapped pictures. I wanted to see what was behind every door. I asked George if the oil we had witnessed being made was virgin or extra virgin. I had always assumed that the grading of \"extra virgin\" denoted a different process or different stage in the olive's ripeness. George shook his head. This was not correct. In fact, all olive oil produced by physical (mechanical) means is virgin. The differentiation of \"extra virgin\" is the virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria. In layman's terms it is the virgin olive oil that has low free acidity and no quality defects.", "The final room we visited that day was lined with shiny steel tanks, much like a winery. The storage of the olive oil in steel tanks helps to preserve it and keep it from oxidizing. It's the final resting place for the olive oil before it is bottled.", "In Greek, the word theoxenia comes from mythology and relates to hospitality; how hosts treat guests or even strangers. It's an important part of Greek culture. This was something George clearly keeps in mind. Before leaving the facility that day, George sent me home with a box filled with bottles of olive oil: virgin, extra virgin, organic extra virgin. That night, and many nights since, I have enjoyed his olive oils. In each bite I can taste the olive grove and its bright sun-kissed fruit. I can't help but think that everyone, even the French, might fall in love with olive oil if they had a chance to taste the Greek rendition."], "targetTitle": "Making Olive Oil in the Peloponnese", "targetDescription": "Even though the Peloponnese is only an hour's drive away from Athens, it's as if you're entering another world, or at least another country.

So we decided to do some research about how you can actually do this.", "First, let's talk about all those creams, pills, treatments, and surgeries that promise to give you a way longer, stronger boner.", "They... probably won't work. \"You can only maximize your size to what you’re capable of achieving,\" Dr. Harry Fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and author of The New Naked, tells BuzzFeed Life.", "Even those penile extenders and stretchers that claim to work over time would actually just be stretching your flaccid length, and that has absolutely no correlation to how big you get when hard, says Fisch. So don’t waste your money on a product or service that swears it can give you five more inches. \"There’s no actual scientific study that they rely on.\"", "\"Here’s the thing,\" says Fisch. \"You can increase the size of your penis — visually. The way you can do it is by losing weight.\"", "This is not a trap. When you have excess fat around your pubic area and stomach, it could make your penis seem smaller. \"If you lose weight, you can actually gain an inch or two because the [pubic] fat would be less,\" says Fisch.", "So if you've noticed a little extra weight around that area, losing a few might come with the added bonus of looking bigger where you actually want to. If you're not sure where to start, check out our Clean Eating Challenge and our 28-Day Get Fit Challenge for some inspiration.", "Another way to look bigger: Trim your pubic hair.", "Again, not a trick, just an aesthetic truth. Cutting back the hedges will make your penis look longer. Obviously, pubic hair grooming is a personal preference, but if you’re goal is to be bigger, this seems way less painful than some shady penile extender you can buy off the internet.", "Then make sure your boner is at maximum capacity... because, it might not be.", "\"Whatever your maximal length or girth is, you can’t get it bigger than that,\" says Fisch. \"However, a lot of men don’t meet their potential.\"", "That’s usually because they’re not getting enough blood flow to the penis, which could be the result of being overweight, smoking, increased cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. So the first step in your penis-growing experiment should be to get the rest of your body healthy — especially your cardiovascular system. \"What’s good for the heart is good for the penis,\" says Fisch.", "And OK, yes, there are some pills you can take.", "Obviously erectile dysfunction meds like Viagra and Cialis are the most common. While they won’t necessarily add inches, they do increase blood flow to the penis. So if you’re not getting a firm erection on your own, these can help you hit your peak penis length. Talk to your doctor if you think you could benefit from a prescription.", "Supplements can also help, like antioxidants to increase your vascular health or l-arginine to increase nitric oxide and blood flow — both of which can lead to stronger boners, says Fisch.", "It's worth noting here that if you're having problems getting or maintaining an erection, or if your erections just aren't what they used to be, that could be a sign of a bigger health issue, like heart disease. Definitely talk to your doctor if you're experiencing problems like this. Don't just borrow a few pills from your friend's Viagra Rx.", "ALL THAT BEING SAID, you really shouldn’t worry so much about your size anyway. Seriously.", "First of all, if you're feeling ill-equipped after watching porn — stop comparing your goods to a porn star's. The average erect penis is 5.4 inches, and most men fall within an inch of that, says Fisch. Chances are, you're actually pretty close to average.", "And if you're worrying about your size pleasing your partner, remember that penetration is just one part of sex, and everyone's preferences are different. Many women don't even orgasm from penile-vaginal sex, for instance, and other people don't care very much about size or length. The size of your penis could possibly be unrelated entirely to your partner's ability to experience pleasure.", "Now, let’s have an honest conversation about those who do have a smaller than average penis.", "Sure, you may encounter partners who may be turned off by that, as with any physical or sexual preference. But you’ll also find partners who are turned on by it, or who don’t care either way. It’s all about finding the right sexual compatibility with the right partner — and that might include adding more oral stimulation, manual stimulation, sex toys, and so on. It's 100% entirely possible to have an amazing sex life with any size penis (or, you know, none at all).", "Bottom line: You can't magically grow a bigger penis... and that's OK.", "Yes, you can make some small health and aesthetic tweaks to have the biggest and hardest penis that's physically possible for you. But in the end, the best thing you can do for yourself is to worry less about size, and instead focus on finding a partner who you're sexually compatible with.'"], "targetTitle": "Here’s How To

So I said, all right I’m going to outline this thing, because I had written a shitty screenplay in between and I didn’t want to do that again. I did an outline, about 100 pages long, and kind of just dumped everything from the book into it. I said, okay let’s go get the rights, and then they came back to us and said that they had made a mistake. The rights were not available. Same people still owned it.", "After you had put all that time into it!", "I was making \"The Adjustment Bureau\" at the time and was sitting in a trailer for a large chunk of the day. So it was like are you going to watch TV or do this? When I was told I couldn’t have it, I thought well if they have owned this thing for so long and haven’t done anything with it I’m just going to write it anyway. And if someone else makes it first, fine. Eventually Bob Gersh from The Gersh Agency worked out the deal.", "Do you think it made the project that much more appealing because you couldn’t have it at first?", "It sort of alleviated the pressure of a production deal or deadline in a way. When you’re sitting around, like actors do, and you start to go crazy because you need an outlet, I would do this. At the end of the day, I’d put in a few hours and crank it around a little bit and I wouldn’t feel crazy that day.", "Do you have a different itch that’s satisfied by writing versus acting?", "It’s the same if I were acting in a play or directing. Creative people go on vacation and four days in you’re like I gotta get out of here. I have a lot of energy, so I’m told. I surf a lot.", "You live in L.A.?", "Half the time. For \"Mad Men\" we’re in New York so I have a place I go surfing in Long Island.", "Isn’t that freezing?", "In the winter it is. But there’s all kinds of gear now, it’s like skiing almost. If I sit around and do nothing for a while, I get a little screwy.", "What did you find most compelling about the material in \"God’s Pocket\"? What made you want to make this film?", "It’s very visual, which appealed to me. I sort of see things in pictures -- I don’t know whether that makes me dumb or smart. Like a kid almost. And the dialogue, by which I mean the characters, just the way they expressed themselves was interesting. It was a simple, to the point way of saying things without saying everything.", "The book is very interior. It takes place in Mickey’s head, which was difficult to do in a film. You have to show that, you can’t tell it. That was a challenge. Mickey’s state of mind and his anxiety in hanging on to this woman that he feels lucky to be with. He feels that if I lose this woman then I’ll never get anybody else like that. I think there’s a sentence that says he realized that would be the last woman he would ever get without paying for it. So even though she might not be in love with him anymore, he doesn’t really belong in this place, he has no affinity for this place, he just has this woman.", "What I think you get from Christina’s performance is the disappointment she feels. He’s not picking up on the signals of what she needs, you see them having sex and obviously that’s not going very well. He can’t express himself. And she needs something. She needs to find out what happened to her son. She needs him to step up and do the right thing, and he’s trying but they’re missing each other.", "Did you consider acting in the film?", "No. I got asked if I was going to, and every time I said no, people were like, \"good idea.\" [laughs] Which I was like, \"what the hell do you mean by that?\"", "I ask because you’ve directed a handful of \"Mad Men\" episodes.", "That’s the least sort of fun of the whole thing -– being in it. Some moments where you get relaxed enough where you know the scene, have done your homework, know the lines, and you sit down and it can be really fun. Because you know what you’re doing on one side of the camera and know what you’re doing on the other.", "Like Woody Allen, I mean I would never even put myself in the same stratosphere, but he is Woody Allen. He knows what he knows and he has the time he has. Ben Affleck -- I have to say, I admire the hell out of that guy with a move like \"Argo.\" To direct it and then give that kind of performance. I don’t know how the hell he dealt with that stress.", "Another example of directors starring in movies is here at Sundance –- Zach Braff’s new film \"Wish I Was Here.\"", "I’m interested in Zach taking 10 years to do this. I’m sure there are all kinds of reasons –- he was acting, he was being successful in all kinds of ways. I’d like to try it sometime, but you’d have to build in the assurance that you have the proper amount of time so you didn’t feel like \"Oh I shouldn’t have done this.\"", "How did you cast this film? Did you just ask Christina Hendricks at the water cooler to come be in your movie?", "I went to Phil [Seymour Hoffman] first. You go through the proper channels because you don’t want to burden anybody with \"do me a favor.\" That’s a drag. I sent him the script and I anticipated that he would let me down easy and say I like it but I don’t have time. I had sent it with an offer for the part of Shelburne. He called and said, \"I love the script, but I want to play Mickey.\" And it took me about two minutes to realize what a great idea that was. So I said all right, in.", "Then I mentioned it to Christina because I was directing an episode of \"Mad Men\" and saw her through the monitor and just realized she was the perfect person. I hadn’t gotten Phil to officially commit yet so I said here’s the script, I’d love you to play this part and I hope to get Phil. She was thrilled. I sent it to Richard Jenkins who is represented by my agent. About 45 minutes later, he called and said he was in. And then John Turturro read it and called up and said he was busy doing a movie but that he wanted to do it too. I was just floored.", "There’s a scene where Christina is up on a balcony and the men are below in the street looking up at her. She slowly walks inside and that quiet moment really illuminated how much power her character has in this film.", "She condoned this guy being beaten to death because he took advantage of her. What I wanted to convey was that this is a woman who knows her currency. All these guys know their weight in the world -- whether it’s slapping somebody around or using the way you look to get what you want. She knows this guy wants to get in her pants and she wants to find something out. She realized in that scene in the field that the way to do that is to let him do what he wants. But then he doesn’t give her what she wants. And in the end she watches him getting beaten in the street and she just walks away, letting it happen. If she had said stop, they would have stopped.", "You mentioned earlier that making this movie 10 years ago would have been very different. What do you think you bring to the table now?", "I think just seeing more of everything. Life. You get to a point where you’re young and you’re an actor and everything is always about \"if I could just get this,\" \"if I could only get that.\" And then you start to realize this is my place in the food chain. This is what I do well. I don’t do everything well. I can’t play everything. I’m not a movie star. I don’t want to be a movie star. Your aspirations become more your own. And then it occurs to you to want to put your own foot forward creatively. You watch other people do their thing and you think, \"I could do this. I can try at this.\"", "You also realize that there are sophisticated degrees of performing. There’s actor A, B, C and then there’s Phil Hoffman. And Richard Jenkins and Christina Hendricks and John Turturro. And the fact that they said yes .", "That’s also a testament to you.", "But when it really comes down to it, it’s because you recognize what they do.

But a study published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that the pH of plain sparkling water, about 5, is not low enough to erode enamel.", "Carbonation does not in itself lead to dental erosion, said Dr. John Ruby, an adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, who co-authored the paper. \"It’s when they add citric acid or phosphoric acid that’s in your classic soft drinks that the pH can drop below the critical pH of 4, where you then can have dental erosion as an outcome. For example, Coca-Cola has a pH of about 2.4,\" making it potentially over 100 times more erosive than sparkling water (because pH is on a logarithmic scale).", "Bottled seltzers that have been flavored with citric acid, the acid found naturally in citrus fruits like lemons and limes, may be acidic enough to damage enamel. But you can get flavor in a less acidic form by adding a slice of lemon or lime (or other fruits, vegetables or herbs, such as cucumber, mint or basil) to plain sparkling water.", "According to a spokesman from the American Dental Association, the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water. In-home sparkling water makers, such as SodaStream, have gained popularity in recent years because they save money and have environmental benefits, but an additional advantage of making your own sparkling water from the tap may be the fluoride, which the ADA emphasizes is essential for maintaining long-term oral health.", "An additional health note: Club soda, which contains added sodium to mimic the taste of mineral water, is not the same as seltzer. The amount of sodium can be small and varies by brand, but it can add up if consuming many servings.

And while it's true that there's really nothing you can do to ensure that you never have to deal with everyday psychopaths, apparently there is at least one way you could decrease your chances--you could avoid going into certain professions.", "According to a fascinating (if not exactly easily actionable) recent PsyBlog post, psychopaths aren't evenly scattered through the population .

Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent, and takes college courses, rarely making it to class. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father’s global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he’s truly gone.  Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can’t understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.", "Going explicitly against his final wishes, she leaves everything she knows behind in search of her dad’s last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan.  But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous.  Suddenly, the stakes couldn’t be higher for Lara, who—against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit—must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown.

Physical therapy was my focus, and the goal was to get back to my favorite pastime — rowing. It had kept me in shape for years, and I was missing early mornings on the Potomac.", "Months later, I still hadn’t picked up an oar. Instead, I’d endured anemia, weight loss, fevers, stiffness and sometimes excruciating pain in my hips and legs. I felt as if I’d been hit by the flu, or maybe a truck. Getting out of bed was painful, and getting into a boat again seemed an impossible task.", "The culprit: polymyalgia rheumatica, or PMR, an autoimmune disease that spreads painful inflammation through most of the body’s joints.", "Never heard of it? Neither had I. Yet it strikes many older Americans, usually in their 70s and 80s, more women than men. The afflicted are more often of Northern European extraction, indicating to researchers that genetics may be at work.", "Fortunately, PMR responds quickly to the steroid drug prednisone. The important thing is to recognize, not ignore, the symptoms and seek help. I felt better within a day of finally seeing my doctor, being diagnosed and taking my first dose of prednisone. In most cases, the condition can be cured, although slowly over months, sometimes years. And in some situations it can be complicated by a more serious disease.", "Why and how PMR strikes is mysterious, although researchers are looking at viruses or stress as triggers for the disease. But undeniably, it is associated with aging, and particularly the aging immune system.", "With the first wave of baby boomers heading into their 70s this year, America’s elderly population will swell, and doctors think there will almost certainly be more cases of PMR.", "Basically, polymyalgia rheumatica tricks the immune system into attacking its own body — sending antibodies and immune cells into the hundreds of fluid-filled sacs called bursae that lie throughout our joints and surrounding soft tissue. In the healthy body, those sacs — some no wider than a dime, others the size of a silver dollar — keep our joints moving smoothly. But when inflamed by PMR, they cause pain and stiffness. PMR also impedes the bone marrow’s ability to make red blood cells, causing anemia.", "Such an inflammatory response is like a complex cascade, according to Marcy O’Koon Moss, director of consumer health for the Arthritis Foundation, which counts PMR among more than 100 diseases it focuses on.", "\"It’s not one thing that happens. The cells involved signal each other and communicate,\" she said.", "Many people stricken with PMR confuse their symptoms with aging and just soldier on. But as the disease progresses and becomes more debilitating, most figure that something beyond old age is at work.", "Phil Ringo, 74, of Haverford, Pa., couldn’t imagine what was wrong four years ago when he began feeling sore and ill.", "\"I thought I’d gone from a pretty vigorous 70-year-old to an old, old man,\" he said. \"Grandchildren were saying, ‘What’s wrong with Papa?’ \"", "Unable to get out of a chair or into a cab without a struggle, he got no answers from his doctors. And when he tried for an appointment with one of the nation’s top diagnostic clinics, \"they basically said, ‘You’re an old guy.’ \" Ringo said. \" ‘ Just get used to it.’ \" He was finally diagnosed and treated after a friend with the disease convinced him to see a rheumatologist.", "Actually PMR is famously tricky to diagnose.", "\"A definitive test does not exist for PMR,\" said rheumatologist Rebecca Manno, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine faculty member and researcher. \"And there are other conditions that mimic PMR,\" such as rheumatoid arthritis, various infections and even some forms of cancer.", "So the diagnostic process can be torturous. Leslie Kermath, 70, of Whitefish, Mont., spent almost a month undergoing tests before her doctor felt confident that PMR was causing her pain, stiffness and fever.", "Along the way, she got antibiotics for an existing urinary tract infection, was sent to the hospital for a chest X-ray and a CAT scan after a test flagged a possible blood clot. Later she had another CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, because her hips were terribly painful. A Lyme disease test came back negative.", "Eventually, her blood tests, which showed increasing levels of inflammation, plus her symptoms and age, nailed the diagnosis for Kermath’s doctor, who started her on prednisone.", "\"How many women of Caucasian origin, who are older, think they’re just aging and can’t do everything they used to — when they actually have this disease?\" said Kermath, who is an avid hiker.", "Most doctors suspecting PMR order several blood tests, almost always two that look for inflammation: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, known as the ESR test, and another for CRP, or C-reactive protein. Doctors also check for antibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis, to rule out that disease.", "When I finally dragged myself to my internist three months after my symptoms showed up, she immediately suspected PMR. Given my age — 73 — my symptoms and lab results showing considerable inflammation and anemia, she started me on prednisone and sent me to a rheumatologist. After eight weeks of prednisone, my inflammation numbers had fallen to near normal and my anemia was under control.", "My rheumatologist has reduced my steroid dose, but only very gradually because rebounds do happen. The hope is that I can be steroid-free — a sign of a cure — sometime in 2017.", "\"Treating PMR is one of the more gratifying parts of my practice,\" said my doctor, Joseph P. Laukaitis. \"In my experience, about 95 percent of patients fully recover.\"", "For a PMR patient, prednisone feels like a miracle drug because it so quickly attacks inflammation and banishes the pain and stiffness. But in fact, prednisone is \"wonderful, wicked\" in Manno’s words. The side effects that some people experience are considerable: a thinning of the bones (already a problem for many older women), high blood pressure, weight gain, high blood sugar, insomnia and a distinctive addition of facial fat known as \"moon face.\"", "Most patients who take prednisone for PMR will also be prescribed a drug to slow bone loss, and that medication, too, has side effects.", "Although diagnosing PMR can be difficult, doing so is crucial because a much more serious disease, giant cell arteritis, strikes about 10 to 20 percent of people with PMR. Giant cell arteritis causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels in the head and elsewhere. Untreated, it can cause blindness, stroke, even death. PMR patients can expect their doctors to look for symptoms of GCA: severe headaches, tender scalp, jaw pain and blurred vision.", "Any one of those can indicate that the arteries of the head are inflamed. The diagnosis often requires a biopsy of one of the arteries in the scalp to confirm inflammation. Again, prednisone is the treatment.", "Much of today’s research into PMR and GCA looks for alternatives to prednisone.", "Biologics — drugs made from living organisms — hold promise because some can \"inhibit an inflammatory response as it picks up steam,\" the Arthritis Foundation’s O’Koon Moss said. \"It’s like interrupting a chain reaction.\"", "\"There are also promising clinical trials of drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and have FDA approval for that. And they may be effective for PMR,\" Manno said.", "Until other drugs become available, prednisone will remain the preferred treatment despite all its of downsides.", "As I face months of treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica, taking smaller and smaller doses of prednisone each month, I hope to avoid remission and eventually regain my strength. Exercise is key, as it so often is when ill health strikes, so you’ll find me on the stationary bike or walking or, if not rowing, at least beginning to build up stamina on the indoor rowing machine.", "The rowing season of 2016 may have eluded me, but the 2017 season is only months away."], "targetTitle": "I’d never heard of this condition until the terrible joint pain set in", "targetDescription": "Don’t delay going to the doctor, because treatment can make you feel better fast.", "targetKeywords": "joint pain, pmr, polymyalgia rheumatica, prednisone, aging joints, pain management, cortisone shot, immune system", "targetMedia": null, "targetUrl": null, "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": null, "spoilerPublisher": null}, "spoiler": ["polymyalgia rheumatica"], "spoilerPositions": [[[3, 13], [3, 35]]], "tags": ["phrase"]}

You buy a bond. Then you get back interest payment. So easy, even your great uncle Mort can do it.", "Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent.", "These days, things aren't so straightforward: The sovereign-debt markets have devolved into a bizarro world of upside-down expectations. Yields on government bonds from all around the world have been plunging thanks to anxious investors buying them for their safety. (Bond yields fall as prices rise.) And in many instances, the returns have cratered below zero. As Quartz reports Thursday, \"around a third of all developed-country government debt—or more than $7 trillion, in terms of market value—is now trading at negative yields,\" meaning that buyers are willing to pay more for these bonds than they will eventually get back if they hold them to maturity. This is remarkable. Countries like Germany have been selling short- and midterm debt at negative yields for a while, but now it’s happening with bonds dated for 10 years or longer. Investors are basically banging down the door for the guarantee that they will only lose a little bit of money over the next decade or two.", "The most mind-blowing example of this trend is Switzerland. Last week, yields on all of its government bonds, out to 50 years, turned negative. Investors are now expected to pay for the privilege of lending money to the Swiss for a half-century at a time. Other countries are getting nearly as good deals. Fifteen-year German and Japanese bond yields have also drifted below zero. Even economically wounded Spain can borrow for a few years at a time and theoretically make a profit. It's like a bad financial-world play on a Yakov Smirnoff joke: In Switzerland, lender pay you!", "Why are investors settling for these kinds of terms? For one, they don't see many other safe options. The world economy still feels shaky, especially after the Brexit vote, which sent bond yields even lower. Meanwhile, stashing cash in a vault somewhere costs money and effort—you need to cover the cost of security and storage. So they're willing to pay governments to essentially hold their euros or yen or Swiss francs. The fact that long-dated bonds are going negative also means that the markets don't expect inflation to rise much down the line, which means they don't expect world growth to pick up much either. It may even be a sign that some investors see deflation on the horizon, since a bond with a negative yield could theoretically be profitable if prices fall enough in a country.", "All of which is to say: Today's sub-zero bond yields are a sign of how deeply pessimistic investors have become about both the near and somewhat distant future. And if they stay down, they could create some nasty problems of their own. When long-term interest rates fall too low, for instance, it makes it very hard for banks to earn a profit by borrowing and lending. This is playing out all over, but right now, people are looking very nervously at Italy's banks in particular, which are parched for profits while sitting on a pile of bad loans. As Matt O'Brien notes at the Washington Post, low bond yields around the world can make it hard for central banks to ever raise rates, since the second they do, investors will rush to buy that government's bonds. Among other things, that can push up the value of a currency, hurting exports and risking deflation."], "targetTitle": "Something Crazy Is Happening to Swiss Bonds, and It’s a Sad Sign for the World Economy", "targetDescription": "Investing in government debt used to be a boring, pretty straightforward proposition.

{"uuid": "6815811f-28d5-4e7f-8c0b-084a1884ca02", "postId": "4xney3", "postText": ["Shower Habits You Need To Stop Doing Immediately"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["Did you know theres actually a right way to shower? Get ready turn down that water temperature and drop the shampoo. Here are the things you need to stop doing while showering.", "Showering is—and should be—a daily habit for most of us, and everyone has their own routine. Some people can’t live without washing their hair each day while others chose to skip a day or two, and the differences continue on from there.", "However, did you know that some of the most common shower habits might not actually be that healthy? Believe it or not, some of the things you do every day while taking a shower could be affecting you in ways you’ve never thought of.", "Check out this list to see if your shower habits are doing you more harm than good.", "1. Washing Your Face", "Without a doubt, it’s easier and less messy to wash your face when you’re already in the shower. However, despite the convenience, it’s actually not good for your face. The water that you shower in will typically be much hotter than what you’d wash with at the sink, and the high temperature can make your skin dry out very quickly.", "Those with skin conditions such as acne or rosacea may also find that washing their face with hot water can cause excessive redness and irritation—it could even burst a blood vessel in your face if you wash too aggressively. Use a gentle cleanser and avoid washing your face in the shower, particularly if you have acne-prone skin or rosacea.", "2. Not Washing Your Feet", "You might be thinking that your feet make contact with plenty of water while you’re in the shower, so there’s no real reason to actually bend down and give them a proper wash. You’d be wrong, though.", "Even if you’re not prone to smelly feet, think about how sweaty your feet can get throughout the day. Not only that, but if you’re known to walk around the house or outdoors without socks or shoes, you never know what you might be picking up along the way.", "There’s no excuse for just letting the soap suds run down to your toes anymore—imagine what you’re bringing into your bed every night without giving those feet a good wash.", "3. Not Washing or Replacing Your Loofah Regularly", "Be honest, how long has the same loofah been hanging in your shower? Months? YEARS? As it turns out, that can be terrible for your health. This video demonstrates why:", "Consider treating yourself to a new sponge or loofah the next time you’re out, or create a cute and convenient place to hang the one you have for air drying.", "4. Using a Soap Dish", "Yes, that built-in soap dish is there forever, but using it for its intended purpose actually isn’t that good of an idea. The majority of people don’t use bars of soap these days but, for those who do, be aware that leaving a bar of soap in one spot could be encouraging bacteria to grow on it—bacteria that you’re then going to spread over your entire body the next time you lather up.", "If you have reasons for resisting the switch to liquid body wash, try finding a wire soap dish or one that has holes in the bottom so any remaining water can drain away once you’re out of the shower.", "5. Using Scented Soaps", "Yes, those soaps that make your bathroom smell like a tropical rainforest or a freshly-made vanilla cupcake do transport you to a place of olfactory luxury while sudsing up, but those very fragrances could be doing a number on your skin at the same time.", "Anyone who notices their skin seems particularly irritated after a shower should look to their soap as the first culprit. Fragrances can irritate sensitive skin very easily, so it’s best to use something unscented to keep your skin in the best shape. Plus, you won’t have to worry about the scent of your soap mixing with the scent of your perfume to create \"questionable\" smells.", "6. Showering in Hard Water", "Some people may not even know how to tell if their water is considered hard, but figuring it out and taking steps to adjust it could save your hair and skin from a lot of damage.", "Hard water is defined by its high concentration of minerals like magnesium and calcium, which can end up making your skin break out or cause a layer of buildup on your hair. Those with dyed hair may even find that hard water strips the color out of their strands, or at least causes their tint to fade a little quicker.", "If you’re unable to add a water softener to your shower, try incorporating a clarifying shampoo into your routine to remove any buildup caused by those pesky minerals.", "7. Avoiding Cold Showers", "Most people wouldn’t even dream of standing in cold water for more than a second, let alone taking an entire shower in water that’s anything less than steaming hot.", "Still, cold water showers can actually be really beneficial for your skin and hair, and you only need 30 seconds under a cold stream to see a difference. A quick blast of cold water is said to improve your immune function, increase your metabolism, and increase the amount of stress you can tolerate.", "In addition to speeding up your metabolism, a study done in 2009 suggests that regularly taking a cold shower could even help you lose weight over time.", "8. Using Old Razors", "For most of us, old razors aren’t something we thoughtfully replace on a regular basis. Instead, they just sit in the shower until we finally cave and get a new one. Razors, whether you’re buying replacement heads or the kind that are entirely disposable, are surprisingly expensive—so why throw one out after a certain period of time if it still seems to work?", "Well, just because a razor is shaving off your unwanted hairs doesn’t mean it’s doing so effectively. If you notice that your skin gets red and inflamed after you shave, it’s because the blades are dull and it’s time for a replacement.", "9. Leaving Your Razor in the Shower", "Remember how leaving your wet bar of soap in your dingy old soap dish makes it a breeding ground for bacteria? The same thing goes for your razor. There are plenty of nooks and crannies in your razor that make perfect spots for bacteria to hide, and the problem will only get worse when the razor is sitting in a warm, wet environment.", "If you don’t actually want to store your razor outside of the shower, at least make sure that you hang it up when you’re done using it so it can air dry.", "10. Over Exfoliating", "Giving your skin a gentle scrub every now and then is a good idea, but doing so every day could actually be causing damage. For anyone who doesn’t know, your skin actually exfoliates itself by renewing every 27 days or so.", "Anyone who chooses to exfoliate their skin every day is aggressively going after fresh skin cells, which can make your skin red and irritated as a result. It’s best to let some dead cells build up on the surface of your skin before reaching for your favorite scrub so that, you know, there’s actually something there worth exfoliating.'"], "targetTitle": "These Are The Shower Habits That You Need To Ditch", "targetDescription": "Everyone showers, but not everyone showers the right way. Although these habits are common, they're not very healthy.", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://archive.is/DGbqz/ffbe7e11bb732f0e2f0f3e0776be9d26243f4eb3.png",

Some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @Jesus.", "There are a lot fewer version of \"Kanye.\" \"Kanye,\" which includes other people named Kanye (though there are far less people named Kanye than Jesus), \"Kanye West\" and @kanyewest.

Looking to minimize instances of other people named Jesus and Kanye, we decided to start our search comparing \"Kanye West\" with \"Jesus Christ\":", "According to the data, in the last year worldwide, looking at only original Tweets (no retweets, no replies), \"Jesus Christ\" had 3,936,585 mentions, while \"Kanye West\" had 4,541,349 mentions. Pretty impressive for the 36-year-old rapper.", "While West's total was greater overall, on a typical day, Kanye didn't have more tweets than Jesus. Kanye's numbers were skewed by a few high mention days and his median tweets/day (9,981) were, in fact, lower than Jesus's median tweets/day (10,458). In fact, Jesus had more tweets on the majority of days (187 out of the 365 days in the year).", "So, using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" their Twitter mentions are pretty close.", "But what about the foreign language tweets?

Usage of the exclamatory \"Jesus Christ\" is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to Christianity, so it may still be a good signal for Jesus's popularity among the Twitterati. That being said, the idiomatic Jesus Christ doesn't directly refer to the person Jesus Christ, while Kanye West refers to the person Kanye in almost all cases, so if we're looking for an apples-to-apples comparison, then Jesus Christ's numbers are significantly smaller.", "How much smaller?

He even bottle-fed her with a mix of puppy formula and heavy cream.", "As each day passed, Biscuits grew bigger and stronger, until she eventually became a healthy adult squirrel. In addition to getting the gift of life, though, Biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with Longo, gained a new family.", "Indeed, alongside her surrogate mother, Biscuits gained some four-legged family friends – in the shape of Longo’s dogs.

This is what they do.

It has to do with the Warriors' bench being worthy of a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. It has to do with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love being underachieving one-way players in a series that demands two-way play against a team that has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they'll exploit weak defenders with cruel efficiency. It has to do with the Cavs needing J.R. Smith to be a consistent offensive producer on a nightly basis if they plan on winning. It has to do with the Cavs daring Draymond Green to beat them and then him doing just that.

No problem. The clean and classy look works very well here too!", "Pop culture and the media has a huge influence on how men sport their hair, so it's no surprise men emulate the hairstyles of their favorite musicians and celebrities to reflect the times. They even find inspiration from past trends, making everything old, new again. TV shows like Mad Men brought back the Don Draper cut, with tightened sides and a sharp part on the left side of the head that was typical among business professionals in the late 60s.With a population of roughly 318 million people here in the U.S., there is a huge range of styles and opinions when it comes to haircuts. But which is the cut that gets requested the most? GQ recently asked 500 barbers and stylists across our nation for the top three most requested haircuts. Their expectations about haircut preferences varying by region were...cut short. Before revealing the most requested haircut, here's a look at what's not on the top of everyone's list. Perhaps the mullet dominates in Kentucky or Oklahoma. Popularized by musicians like Rod Stewart and David Bowie (RIP), the mullet was predominant as far back as the early 70s. Some guys prefer to stay stuck in the era of disco. Still, it is not a popular haircut. No judgment here. You do your 'do the way you do!Perhaps the buzzcut is favored more in Iowa.Sadly, the buzzcut lacks the length of hair enough to be sweeping the nation. Maybe the Southwest prefers the Caesar's cut.None of these styles were in hot demand. But when all the data was compiled, there was one haircut that was consistently favored among men from Schenectady to Cincinnati, Portland to Nashville, Juneau to NYC, and every city in between. So which cut made the cut? There's no official name for the style, but it's basically the 'undercut,' long on top and short on the sides. The clean-cut style of a longer crown with a clipper cut fade on the sides won out as the preferred cut of choice. The prime example of the desired haircut is sported here by one of the most desirable men in Hollywood: Ryan Reynolds.The style is easily adaptable for both casual and formal occasions. This haircut works with most types of hair, including thick, wavy and curly hair. Want the same haircut? GQ shares how to ask your barber for the popular cut:The popular style is also easy to maintain, and there are plenty of options to play with.The word is out. This is the nation's popular haircut for now. But how long can it last? Will barbers be forever shearing this time-transcending method of the undercut, or will the style last as briefly as a cheap bottle of Dep gel? Time will tell, but since it's summer, it's gotta feel wonderful to clipper-cut the sides of your head. Your head will feel cool in the summer heat, and you'll be looking even cooler!

Alternatively, perhaps Cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues.", "Fans should also consider the possibility that Cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release.

The perverted powwow officially began when one friend, let’s call him Freddy, announced something to the effect of, \"Having your prostate milked is awesome.\"", "I nearly choked on my beer. Someone else chimed in: \"It’s the male g-spot.\" Another head nodded. A female friend walked into our circle at that moment and nonchalantly volunteered: \"Yeah, my ex-boyfriend liked me to stick a finger in his butt.\"", "Well, then. It wasn’t the first time I’d heard young heterosexual men talking about being on the receiving end of a wandering finger, or female friends dishing on their male partners’ self-directed anal fixation, but the consensus in the room was startling nonetheless. For perhaps the first time in my life, I felt like a sexual square.", "Then, a week later, heavily circulated rumors (that have been completely unverified) alleged that R&B singer Usher’s unreleased sex tape showed him on the receiving end of sex with his wife (perhaps wielding a strap-on). It’s no secret that more Americans are having anal sex than ever before: A study published last year in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that more than 45 percent of women in their late 20s had tried anal sex. For my generation, the back-door option is like what the blow job was to the generation that came before — just a fun new taboo waiting to be broken. The phenomenon of heterosexual guys participating in all sorts of arse play is something different, though. I’ve seen female-on-male strap-on sex go from the sort of thing tittered about in women’s magazines to hearing a male friend once drunkenly blurting out in a bar that he loved it.", "But I live in San Francisco; my sample is skewed. I set out to find some reliable data on the matter, but no such luck. As Debby Herbenick, a co-author of the study mentioned above and a sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute, told me: \"There is no good national-level data on this topic.\" Her research reflected that 11 percent of men in their early 20s reported having been on the receiving end of anal sex. But that survey didn’t specify whether there was a sex toy or penis involved, or if it was oral or digital stimulation.", "Without solid stats, the best way to get some perspective on this phenomenon is to talk to sexologists. Charlie Glickman, a Good Vibrations sex educator, told me that he believed \"more heterosexual men are discovering prostate and anal play with their female partners than ever before.\" His colleague Carol Queen, a staff sexologist, says, \"Lots of guys don’t talk about [it], but do it anyway,\" and \"plenty of heterosexual men include anal penetration in masturbation at least sometimes.\" In the years after her educational X-rated video \"Bend Over Boyfriend\" premiered in 1998, it was the shop’s best-selling tape, and the top rental. Tristan Taormino, the sex educator behind several anal-focused porn flicks, including the \"Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men,\" has noticed that guys are increasingly \"feeling safe enough to explore their fantasies\" in this area.", "Part of this is due to the practice rising to mainstream awareness. In 2001, popular sex columnist Dan Savage held a contest to come up with a slang word to describe the act. The winner was \"peg\" (the runner-up was \"bob,\" as in \"bend over boyfriend\"). It’s a lot easier to talk about when you have a cute verb to describe it. Another major factor is that the stigma of receptive anal play as \"a gay thing\" has been somewhat lessened. I’ve seen defensively heterosexual guys boast about prostate stimulation; these are the kind of guys I’ve actually heard use the irritating I’m-not-gay qualifier \"No homo\" (as in, \"I like your shirt — no homo\") — before I wallop them over the head.

In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 — nearly half that of Maryland’s.", "Despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation.

I don’t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.\"", "States with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate.

In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state’s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%.", "Elise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state’s household income. \"When we’re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it’s about jobs.\" Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story.", "Unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work.

This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008.", "The types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions.", "At the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation.

But it's his shot, the repertoire of fadeaways that he's got, his 3-ball was always money and he's a big guy for a 2 or 3 that was always good on the block. He'd run a pick-and-roll going to his right, where he was always deadly.", "I mean, he was a tough matchup because he could post, and he was so freakishly athletic. He'd come off a down pick and just jump up and really nobody could get to his shot. Obviously, he's so athletic that once he got going to the rim, you could challenge him, but he was going to put you on a poster. He was fun to watch during his prime.", "Pierce: He had unique ability, something you hardly see: great athleticism and great shooting touch. Usually you see one without the other. He had the combination of both. That's rare. It's something this league has not seen in a long time.", "Pierce: Dirk changed the game, man. When you look at what he was able to bring with his versatility and his shooting as a 7-footer, to be able to put the ball on the ground, he was one of the first stretch 4s that you see more of today. I mean, he revolutionized the game.", "Players like that are transcendent. He was a transcendent player.", "Carter: First of all, his work ethic. He puts a lot of time in, and it's different than any other player I've ever seen. I've been around long enough to see a lot of guys train and prepare, but he just loves the game. He loves to play. He loves to compete. And he's selfless. He's all about the good of the team.", "That's one thing, having the opportunity to play with a go-to guy, a superstar like himself, is that he's willing to make the right play. It's not always like, 'The play is for me; I have to make the shot.' 'The play is for me; I have to make the right play,' that's his mentality. But when he wants the ball, he's going to say, 'Give me the ball.'", "He's a professional scorer. I say this about myself, too, and you could probably say it about Paul as well: When you see him walk into the arena before a game, you could probably say there's no way in hell that those guys are playing tonight. Then Dirk will come in and drop 35. Regardless of how he feels before the game, once the big lights are on and you come on the court, he knows how to get it done, plain and simple.", "Nowitzki: He was strong. He'd get to his spots. He was a clutch shooter. He definitely had the clutch gene. Great pump fake, could get to the foul line. I mean, he was the complete package from the small forward standpoint. You put a smaller guy on him, he was able to post and shoot over him. Could drive both ways, even ran some pick-and-rolls.", "And when it mattered, he made big shots. I wouldn't say he was a great flat-out 3-point shooter, but when the game was on the line, you never really wanted him shooting the 3. He was a competitor and really just a great all-around player.", "Carter: He was a killer. He's been like that since high school. I remember us playing against each other in the McDonald's [All-American Game] and just being around each other. He's always had the mentality to score and wanted to dominate while having the ability to do whatever he wanted.", "He had the big body and he knew how to use it. There are some people who are big and strong, but they don't use it like that. Paul used it. And he was deceptively quick, so when he got the ball in the logo area and he would swing through and put his body on you, you just hope he missed.", "I've had many, many, many great battles against him and know him very well. Of course, we all know Paul can shoot the heck out of the basketball from the 3-point line. He's just another professional scorer.", "Nowitzki: I was always the young guy, the German wunderkind, the young guy coming up with talent. It felt like the next thing you know, I was 30. Those years just flew by. You're having fun, you're competing every year, and then in the summer, it's not like I was just sitting on my butt in my 20s. I played national team every year, so literally I took like two weeks off and then was right back in the gym working with Holger. If you stay busy, time flies. So my 20s, I felt like they were over in a heartbeat.", "Next thing you know, you're 30 and you're sort of like a mid-aged guy. Couple of young guys, but still a couple older guys. Then the last few years, you're just the oldest guy. It's amazing how 19 years just have flown by. But if you stay busy, if you have a blast ...", "Now, I'm still trying to compete. I enjoy doing it. Obviously, it's not as easy as back in the day. All the extra work you have to put in to stay ready. Now dealing with injuries that I really never had, it takes the fun away a little bit, but hopefully I can [stay healthy] and have fun.", "Pierce: Oh, it's fun. I'm enjoying every moment. Shootaround, I'm enjoying. The bus rides, the plane rides with the guys, I'm enjoying every last bit of camaraderie that I'm going to get with my team.", "In the locker room, on the court, I'm just soaking it all in. I've been around this game for a long time -- a lot of plane rides, a lot of bus rides, a lot of pregame speeches, a lot of national anthems. I'm enjoying the ride, man.", "I know this is the last year, so I'm enjoying it as much as I can.", "Carter: I'm a little uneasy sometimes. Some days, I'm OK with it. I know it's near, and I'm preparing myself for it. But some days, I'm like, 'Man, I'm not ready to walk away from it,' because I still enjoy being in the gym. I still enjoy running around and competing and laughing and joking. There's nothing better when you've done this so long. It's all you know. Maybe not all I know, but all I've done and all I've enjoyed doing at this point.", "Now, I'm prepared to move on to Phase 2. But it's kind of like, you do all the preparation to be prepared, but you're not prepared, if that makes sense. I remember seeing all of the other guys [with the Raptors], seeing Oak [Charles Oakley] and Antonio [Davis] and Kevin Willis and [Hakeem] Olajuwon, watching them in their final years. Then they stepped out in the world and were just kind of like, 'Where do I go from here?' I mean, those guys were prepared.", "It's something I never really thought about until -- I'm going to say five years ago: just making sure I'm ready. Because you hear the stories about guys who step out into the world when they retire, and it's like, 'All right, I have some money in my pocket. Where do I go?' Then just spending and spending, and you hear the next horror story that they go broke. That's something that I vow never to do.", "For me, an idle mind is just awful. I think I'd be a miserable person, and I'd get on a lot of people's nerves if I'm retired and I have nothing to do. I can't just sit around. People are like, 'Oh, you get to retire and go to all these countries and visit.' I can't do that. That's not who I am. I'm not a vacation guy like that. I wouldn't like it. I know that, so I'd have to find something to do. That's where Phase 2 started years ago as far as kind of introducing myself to different people and figuring out what I'm really passionate about.", "The coaching thing is still up in the air. I get asked about it all the time. I enjoy it, but I don't know if I want to do it. It's just the weirdest thing. I guess it makes sense, but to me, it still doesn't make sense. How is it that you enjoy it, have been doing it all these years but can see yourself [coaching full time]? I really can't see myself as a coach as of right now. In the broadcasting world, I can see it clear as day. I'm still fighting with that.", "Other than that, I'm ready to go when the time is [right]. There's some mornings I wake up and it's like, 'Is it one more year? Or is it this year? Or is it three years?' I can never decide on a number. Scary. It really is for me, because I love this game, and I don't want to leave it. Not yet.", "Nowitzki: [Heavy sigh.] That sounds like a lot. But you know, hopefully I can [stay] out there and I can score a few. Vince has been on a tear for a while, and Paul I don't think is playing much, but you know we're going to try. All three of us are competitors. I think as you get older, it's more important to be on a winning team. I'm sure Vince is enjoying that [the Grizzlies] are playing well, and Paul is enjoying the Clippers. We need some work.", "Pierce: It's going to be tough. It's not looking good. I'm not playing much. Our only chance is Vince Carter now. Dirk has been hurt. But who knows? Man, we've got a shot. We've got a shot. But I think LeBron [James], [Dwyane] Wade and [Carmelo Anthony] are going to crush it. LeBron, Wade and Melo are coming. And they're coming fast.", "Carter: It's possible. It's possible. I mean, God willing with health, of course, and opportunity. I think it's possible if we stay healthy. Dirk wants to play another year, and with his ability to score, he's going to get touches. I'm putting all of the pressure on him."], "targetTitle": "The twilight tales of Vince Carter, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce", "targetDescription": "The last holdovers from the Class of '98 discuss draft-night stories, plans for life after basketball and where they rank among the best draft trios in NBA history.", "targetKeywords": "NBA, Dirk Nowitzki, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, 1998 draft, 1998-99, NBA, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, LA Clippers", "targetMedia": null, "targetUrl": null, "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": null, "spoilerPublisher": null}, "spoiler": ["Vince Carter", "Paul Pierce", "Dirk Nowitzki"], "spoilerPositions": [[[0, 24], [0, 36]], [[1, 0], [1, 11]], [[1, 53], [1, 66]]], "tags": ["multi"]}

Remember that everyone has there struggles in life. Most of us choose not share them. Most people with acne don't share it because there ashamed but why should we it's only a stage in our life it won't last forever and it certainly doesn't make us any less of a person. Clear skin or acne you are the same person. I get asked how can I be confident when my skin looks like this? The reason I decided to accept myself for how I looked is because for years I suffered with acne and for years I let my mental health take over, ruin relationships, stop me going out ect all because I was insecure and worried about other people's opinions. Because let's be honest acne isn't nice to look at. I knew I couldn't carry on being this hard on myself to the point I would cry and have a lot of built up stress causing headaches. I thought about the days when I used to have no worries when I was younger and here's what I came up with- I wasn't living life trying to impress anyone I wore no makeup so never felt less beautiful I didn't spend my time trying to make myself look perfect I didn't sit at home comparing myself to others on Instagram It's the world we live in today that makes us think like this. I don't want young girls feeling the same way I did. I don't want them to think they have to look a certain way to be accepted or beautiful. They need more role models embracing there real natural selfs because that is real life. I know how hard it can be but please please practice self love and believe in yourself this alone will make you feel better 💛🌸✨ ------------------------------------------------", "A post shared by Rachel Crawley ☾❂ ॐ (@asprinkleofhealthandbeauty) on Mar 3, 2017 at 12:38am PST", "However, in some of her most recent posts Crawley’s skin has significantly cleared up, and for that she credits one simple diet change.", "After experimenting with taking certain foods out of her diet, she found that sugar and carbs appeared to be the main culprits for her aggressive bouts of acne.

My acne was cystic, red, sore and I had bumps underneath my skin. I felt like I wanted to give up at this point. I then decided to give my diet one last change before I would have seen a dermatologist. I took pictures of my skin so I could see the results as to whether what I was doing was working or not and I started seeing the difference day by day. I wanted to share with you the realism of what people go through. Unfortunately acne isn't seen as normal and is thought as 'ugly' but it's something so many of us experience. It's nothing to be ashamed of. What is to be ashamed of is the perception of what we are supposed to look like. The picture on the right is my skin today! My scars are being treated with natural skincare products that I have found work my skin and I do want to avoid having any treatments to get rid of them. They need time to heal and I'm okay with that. Whatever journey your on to clear you skin don't give up on yourself.

", "'Forget all those claims of \"tells\" and other body language giveaways that reveal when someone is being economical with the truth.

", "'Despite the fact there are no \"one-size-fits-all\" symptoms to spot, the following tips should help alert you to the fact that someone’s not being totally honest with you.'", "The big pause: Lying is quite a complex process for the body and brain to deal with. First your brain produces the truth which it then has to suppress before inventing the lie and the performance of that lie. ", "This often leads to a longer pause than normal before answering, plus a verbal stalling technique like ‘Why do you ask that?’ rather than a direct and open response.", "The eye dart: Humans have more eye expressions than any other animal and our eyes can give away if we’re trying to hide something. ", "When we look up to our left to think we’re often accessing recalled memory, but when our eyes roll up to our right we can be thinking more creatively. Also, the guilt of a lie often makes people use an eye contact cut-off gesture, such as looking down or away.", "The lost breath: Bending the truth causes an instant stress response in most people, meaning the fight or flight mechanisms are activated. ", "The mouth dries, the body sweats more, the pulse rate quickens and the rhythm of the breathing changes to shorter, shallower breaths that can often be both seen and heard.", "Overcompensating: A liar will often over-perform, both speaking and gesticulating too much in a bid to be more convincing. These over the top body language rituals can involve too much eye contact (often without blinking!) and over-emphatic gesticulation.", "The poker face: Although some people prefer to employ the poker face, many assume less is more and almost shut down in terms of movement and eye contact when they’re being economical with the truth.", "The face hide: When someone tells a lie they often suffer a strong desire to hide their face from their audience. This can lead to a partial cut-off gesture like the well-know nose touch or mouth-cover.", "Self-comfort touches: The stress and discomfort of lying often produces gestures that are aimed at comforting the liar, such as rocking, hair-stroking or twiddling or playing with wedding rings. We all tend to use self-comfort gestures but this will increase dramatically when someone is fibbing.", "Micro-gestures: These are very small gestures or facial expressions that can flash across the face so quickly they are difficult to see. Experts will often use filmed footage that is then slowed down to pick up on the true body language response emerging in the middle of the performed lie. ", "The best time to spot these in real life is to look for the facial expression that occurs after the liar has finished speaking. The mouth might skew or the eyes roll in an instant give-away.", "Heckling hands: The hardest body parts to act with are the hands or feet and liars often struggle to keep them on-message while they lie. ", "When the gestures and the words are at odds it’s called incongruent gesticulation and it’s often the hands or feet that are telling the truth.", "Judi James is supporting Macmillan Cancer Support’s new Murder Mystery fundraising game Whodunnit? and says learning how to lie might help if you decide to take part. ", "'While I don’t usually condone lying, this is the perfect opportunity to try your hand at being economical with the truth,' she said. ", "Convince yourself first: The brain likes to see the whole manufactured story which it can then perform using body language. Don’t just think of the transcript, visualise the whole story including all the smallest details.", "Visualisation is the nearest you’ll get to making the lie reality and that helps make your body language signals congruent.", "Relax: To combat the fight/flight response, breathe out slowly and deliberately to relax your muscles, especially the ones in your shoulders, arms and hands. Keep your vocal tone a little lower - lying can make us more shrill.", "Slow your blink rate: Fibbing often causes a give-away accelerated blink rate. Slow your own down a little, as this will help create reassurance in your audience.", "Keep busy: If you’re not very good at lying, try to keep busy when you perform the lie. Actors call this a ‘bit of business’ which is when less competent actors continue washing up or potting plants while being quizzed rather than struggling with their body language. Sip a cup of tea etc. ", "It might look rude but it can be better than over-sharing in terms of your body language giveaways!", "Tell the truth first: In an emergency such as: ‘Do you like my new hair cut?’ or ‘Am I the best lover you’ve ever had?’ it can help if you expel the truth first. For example, ‘It looks terrible!’ or ‘No you’re the worst!’ followed by ‘Only joking, of course you’re wonderful!’", "Macmillan Cancer Support’s new Murder Mystery fundraising game ‘Whodunnit?’ takes place on Saturday 25th March.

For a while now, fans have theorised that the new hero will be called Sombra, but any information further than that has laid out of their grasp.", "Well, this new hero isn’t Sombra. Sorry to those who thought it would be. However, don’t be disheartened, as you’re in for a lot of fun. This new hero’s name? Ana. Ana, the kickass heal-sniper.", "Ana’s inclusion adds a truly unique set of skills for players to get their hands on. Now, you can hang back away from the heat of the action, but still lend support to those in its midst. You can heal, you can put your enemies to sleep, and also lend traditional fire support as you would as a normal sniper.", "Check out the gameplay trailer below for peek at what kind of awesomeness you can expect.", "Much like other heroes, Ana comes with a distinct back story to flesh out her character, and it’s a goodie. Turns out she is Pharah’s mother, and was part of a group very similar (if not just an earlier incarnation of) the Overwatch team.", "Ana taught Pharah all she knows, which explains why she grew up to be such a badass. She states in her origin video that she didn’t want the same life for Pharah as she’d had, although I’d imagine growing up around a group of heroes would kind of set you on that path regardless.", "Ana’s inclusion in the game is a big one, both gameplay and story wise.

This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).", "Stephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century.", "The famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system—which he operates with his cheek—and have around-the-clock care.", "But his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology.", "But like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular. Most patients with ALS—also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease—are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday.", "Why has Hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? We spoke with Leo McCluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared Hawking and his amazing brain.", "What is ALS—and is there more than one form of it?", "ALS, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease—and colloquially as Lou Gehrig's disease in the U.S.—is a neurodegenerative disease. Each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. These are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain—as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. The guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. The disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both.", "It's been known for quite some time that there are variants of ALS. One is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or PMA. It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons.", "There is also primary lateral sclerosis—PLS—and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder.", "The other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy—or progressive supranuclear palsy—which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles.", "Those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. It's now clear that that's not true. It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia.", "One of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true.", "What has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease?", "One thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. On average people live two to three years after diagnosis. But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time.", "Life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm—the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time—even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier.", "Has he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type?", "Juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say. But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say.", "He's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur.", "How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS?", "I would say probably less than a few percent.", "How much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS?", "It's probably a little bit of both. I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had. If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology—it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. But mostly it's about the biology of the disease.", "Hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference?", "I don't believe that adds to longevity.", "ALS still doesn't have a cure. What have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one—or at least better treatments?", "Beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation. I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet.", "What does Stephen Hawking's case mean for people who have the disease?", "It's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease—and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. Unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens."], "targetTitle": "How Has Stephen Hawking Lived Past 70 with ALS?", "targetDescription": "50% of people diagnosed with ALS will live about 4 years.

{"uuid": "81a656d7-8817-4f16-94dc-3bacf5081d42", "postId": "4z1oa2", "postText": ["Ex-Cons Remember Their Worst Jobs After Being Released from Prison"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["Getting a job when you first get out of prison can be a nightmare . Most employers refuse to hire someone fresh out the feds or convicts who are still incarcerated but allowed to get a job through \"work-release.\" Other prisoners are so shell-shocked from being back in a society that changed dramatically while they were locked up, that figuring out how to do basic things like use public transportation or a cell phone can feel like a Herculean task. According to the National Institute of Justice , over 60 percent of ex-cons are jobless up to a year after release.", "That said, getting a job is a necessary step for prisoners to integrate back into society. Often times, it's a requirement by the criminal justice system, or else freshly-released inmates will risk being sent back to the feds. But even when ex-cons do manage to get hired, the work is underpaid, demoralizing, and their employers don't do much to encourage the re-entry process. There are organizers that help former prisoners assimilate into the workforce, but the support is generally few and far between.", "After serving 23 years in the feds, the first job I got on the outside was as a sauté cook at an Italian restaurant, despite my earning two college degrees while in prison. The work sucked, and I was forced to do the grunt work no one else would do, like clean out the fryers every night. I wasn't in any position to argue and risk being canned, and my employers took advantage of this. I dreaded that job, but as I've talked with other ex-cons over the years about their first gigs on the outside, I now consider myself lucky. The fact that over 75 percent of ex-cons are rearrested within five years of releas e should be no surprise when the only jobs offered to people with criminal records are the gigs no one else applies for. VICE chatted with three ex-cons to get more perspective on what re-entering the workforce was like once they got out of prison.", "Image of cattle ranchers via Wikimedia Creative Commons", "Mendoor Smith, 43-Year-Old from Iowa", "Served 12 Years for Marijuana Possession", "Released from Custody in 2013", "The worst job I had was working on a cattle ranch as a utility farmer, making $8.25 an hour. I had to be there from about 6 AM to 5 PM every day, and the commute was 45 minutes from the halfway house I was placed in. It wasn't really tough work, but the handling of manure and animals was rough, as was taking care of the calves and cows. Dealing with cows everyday is messy, and I'd have to clean out their living pens.", "I remember calving one shift during the winter, and when I did my hourly inspection of the herd, I noticed a cow with an extremely bad vaginal prolapse. I called my boss and he called the vet who came out at four in the morning. I had to lift the cow's vaginal insides and hold them while the vet tried to stuff them back inside the cow. After about an hour and a half of lifting and stuffing this slimy, nasty thing, the vet finally got it all back inside and sewed up. When I did my final inspection of the morning at 10 AM, the cow had died. All that work was for nothing. Having to stick my entire arm in a cow to help pull out a calf was not fun either. You work super hard to pull one of the slimy things out, and then you have to scoop the little thing up and take off before the cow attacks you for holding its calf. Having a 1,200 pound animal chase you is a little intimidating.", "I had two coworkers that knew about my [criminal] situation. They asked a lot of questions, stuff about what was prison like and what I did to get all that time. My boss was a good boss. He helped me get my Class A driver's license so I could drive trucks for him. He was a big help and was instrumental in me getting the job I have now. The farm was a tight-knit family, so I was treated well, but the work was completely horrible. It prepared me for the struggle of rebuilding my life after prison, though. It didn't kill me and it made me stronger. That job sucked, but I was still glad to have it because I wouldn't be in the position I'm in today otherwise.", "David Hibdon, 55-Year-Old from Missouri", "Served 10 Years for Drug Conspiracy", "Released from Custody in 2014", "My first job out of prison was the worst job available in Colombia, Missouri. I was picking up trash at the city dump in 100-plus degree weather for $8 an hour. I had to walk around 27 acres and pick up the trash that blew off the trucks, rain or shine. Some days I walked through raw sewage, or mud up to my ankles. The halfway house didn't provide transportation to the job, and I had to walk there every morning. It was a seven mile walk that took over two hours. I had to be there at seven in the morning and got off at 4 PM, with only a short lunch break in between. With my first paycheck, I bought a bike and then it only took me forty minutes to get to work. I was making about 50 bucks a day, but I was required to give 25 percent to the halfway house. If I bought a soda or cigarettes I was almost broke. It took me two months in the halfway house to save up and buy a $500 car.", "I worked there because it was the only job available. Nobody wanted the job because of the stink and the dust blowing on you from the trash trucks. No one else would take these jobs besides ex-cons at the halfway house. And all the other ex-cons that worked there would sleep on a nearby hill or smoke K2 all day while I was working. I was alienated out there. It was one of the most degrading experiences I ever went through, but I got past it. It sure didn't help me become a better person cause I was still the same after.", "I've had four jobs since I've been out, and I never told anyone I was on parole until after I was hired, or they wouldn't have hired me.

Nighttime exposure to artificial light -- which for the great majority of us happens without much thought or awareness -- disrupts the body's circadian rhythm, altering the 24-hour biological clock that controls our sleep-wake cycle. In addition to wreaking havoc with sleep, disruptions to circadian rhythms also have been associated with a number of serious diseases, including cancer, diabetes, depression and heart disease.", "In particular, research in recent years has shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function. Studies have shown that blue wavelength light has uniquely harmful effects on humans and suppresses melatonin levels more vigorously than other light wavelengths. Unfortunately, many energy-efficient light sources produce high concentrations of blue light. Blue light is emitted by electronic devices, energy-efficient light bulbs, and other common light sources.", "Research investigating blue-light blocking -- most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light -- has shown promise. A new study of cataract patients indicates that artificial lens implants can help improve sleep. Scientists at China's Sichuan University studied the effects of blue-light blocking artificial lenses implanted during cataract surgery. The study involved 40 patients who required surgery for cataracts in both eyes. Cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eye's damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens. Cataracts are a common condition among older adults -- approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataracts. The study subjects -- 26 women and 14 men, with an average age of 74 -- were given artificial lenses with blue-light blocking capability. Researchers assessed patients sleep quality before surgery and again two months after surgery. They found patients' sleep had improved significantly across several measures:", "Patients were sleeping more during the night.", "Their sleep quality had improved.", "Their levels of daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness had diminished.", "The number of subjects who met the criteria for \"poor sleepers\" had decreased.", "Lens replacement surgery is necessary for cataract patients. But there are other, less-invasive ways to filter out blue-light that are also being investigated by sleep scientists. Research has shown the benefits to sleep of manipulating and controlling exposure to blue light:", "A study of 20 adults who wore either blue-light blocking or ultraviolet-light blocking glasses for three hours before sleep found that both sleep quality and mood improved among those in the group who wore blue-light blocking glasses, compared to the ultraviolet-light blocking group.", "Shift workers are at especially high risk for circadian rhythm disruptions because of their non-traditional schedules. In a study by scientists at Quebec's Universite Laval, nightshift workers used blue-light blocking glasses at or near the end of their overnight shifts for four weeks. At the end of study period, their overall sleep amounts increased, as did their sleep efficiency.", "While nighttime exposure to blue wavelength light is damaging to circadian rhythms, exposure to blue light isn't always detrimental. Daytime exposure to blue light can stimulate alertness and help sleep later on. A study of 94 office workers found that daytime exposure to blue light during work hours resulted in improvements both to sleep and to daytime functioning, compared to exposure to white light. Subjects who were exposed to blue light experienced improvements to daytime alertness, mood, and concentration. These subjects also experienced decreases in daytime sleepiness and they slept better at night.", "This area of research is critically important, and I expect we will see a great deal more investigation into the effects of blue wavelength light on sleep and health. But you don't need special goggles or eye lens implants to protect your circadian rhythms and your sleep from the negative effects of artificial light. Here are some low-tech suggestions that can help you:", "Limit exposure to artificial light in the hours before bed. The last 1-2 hours before bed should be a time of winding down and preparing for sleep. Decreasing your exposure to light is an important part of this process. You don't have to sit in a pitch-black room, but you should think about beginning to limit your exposure to bright lights, whether from your computer screen or your television. Reading under moderate lamplight is fine. If you're using a tablet to read, bring the screen's brightness level down. Make the last 60 minutes of your bedtime ritual electronics-free -- and keep electronic gadgets and devices out of the bedroom altogether.", "Get light exposure during the day. Daytime exposure to light -- both sunlight and artificial light -- can help strengthen circadian rhythms and boost daytime alertness, leaving you better prepared to sleep when the time comes.", "If you need access to light in the middle of the night, use small nightlights. Rather than switching on hallway or bathroom lights -- and flooding your system with melatonin-suppressing light -- use low-illumination night lights to guide you when you need to get up in the dark.", "Being aware of the effects of nighttime exposure to light and making some basic changes to bedtime routines can go a long way toward getting you the darkness you need to sleep well, even in this ever-bright modern age."], "targetTitle": "Blocking Blue Light Helps Sleep", "targetDescription": "The disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep are well", "targetKeywords": "light in bedroom,nightlight,blue light blocking lens,The Sleep Doctor,light exposure,circadian rhythm,electronics and sleep,Sleep Tips,sleep expert,Sleep Advice,bedtime routine,sleep habits,artificial light and sleep,Dr. Breus,blue wavelength,Electronics in Bedroom,blue light,michael breus,sleep,blue light sleep,artificial light sleep,blue light and sleep", "targetMedia": ["http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rWTZ2PAKL._SL160_.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QKMIg7HvL._SL160_.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1361999/images/o-BLUE-LIGHT-SLEEP-facebook.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/ShopIndieRed.png", "http://assets.huffingtonpost.com/amazon-sidebar.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "targetUrl": "http://huff.to/1eBEXfW", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Blue.", "spoilerPublisher": "HuffPoSpoilers"}, "spoiler": ["blue"], "spoilerPositions": [[[1, 55], [1, 59]]], "tags": ["phrase"]}

Photo: Tom Johnson", "This post originally appeared on VICE UK.", "Good Cop, Bad War is the story of an undercover police officer, Neil Woods, who spent over a decade infiltrating Britain's biggest drug gangs. The book , released last week, provides a unique insight into a world of mind games and violence, where the drug trade acts as a production line for the creation of ruthless gangsters. Ultimately, his experiences led Woods to reject the way drugs are policed in the UK.", "\"The logic of the drugs war only leads one way: the police get smarter, so the criminals get nastier; things can only ever go from bad to worse, from savagery to savagery,\" says Woods. Now, after having left the force, he is chairman of LEAP UK (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition), a pro-drug legalization activist group consisting of ex-law enforcement officials.", "But to what extent are Woods and his colleagues at LEAP UK—and those currently employed in the police force—rare specimens? How thin on the ground are drug cops who think they are fighting the wrong fight? Expressing sympathy for anything other than hardline prohibition—even to their colleagues—is something of a risk in the black and white, \"them and us\" world of police culture.", "Even so, every now and then drug cops open up about the realities of clearing the streets of dealers and drugs.", " Neil Woods buying crack while undercover in 1995. Photo courtesy of Neil Woods", "I spoke to Mike Fisher*, a senior drugs investigator for Britain's organized crime busting bureau, the National Crime Agency (NCA). He asked for his name to be changed to avoid disciplinary action, as his views will definitely not be found anywhere near the pages of the NCA's annual report.", "\"If the NCA stopped targeting drug gangs, it would change nothing,\" he explained. \"You would see little change in the high street. Society would not collapse. As it is, drugs are freely available now. All that would happen is that dealing would be more open. But it may give us more of a chance to deal with crimes such as homicide.\"", "On the surface, it's a counter-intuitive line to take for a senior officer working within an agency for which the drug trade is a key target.", "\"Law enforcement against drugs is completely ineffective and has been since the Misuse of Drugs Act came into force in 1971,\" says Fisher. \"The idea of the state protecting you from yourself just doesn't work. We've spent billions of pounds trying to prohibit drugs, but there's less chance of it working than Canute stopping the waves.", " Photo: Andoni Lubaki", "Fisher tells me that arresting people on the streets for drugs is an endless cycle, and that it's the same with the larger fish. \"Whenever we remove a big guy, someone else—usually a lieutenant—replaces him within days. The more we try, the harder it gets: increased enforcement keeps these people looking over their shoulder; they become more covert about their activity, and that makes our job harder.\"", "Fisher's solution is to take the Portugal route: decriminalize personal use of all drugs, from cannabis to heroin, and look at legalizing production and supply. \"I believe consenting adults have a choice as to what they put in their bodies. It will also make it easier for heroin and crack users to get the help they need and free up police time to go out on patrol and deal with other crimes,\" he says. \"Ideally, production should be wrested from organized criminals and managed by governments.\"", "Surprisingly, he tells me around half of Britain's elite drug detectives at NCA have similar \"liberal\" attitudes to the drugs problem.", "But what about those drug cops working below NCA level, in towns and cities across the UK? To gauge what they truly think about their daily task, you need to be a fly on the wall—so that's the exact position that University of Sheffield criminologist Dr. Matthew Bacon took. He spent two years embedded with drug detectives in a town and a major city (the identities of which are secret) in the UK and wrote about his experiences in Taking Care of Business , published last month.", "Most officers were anti-drugs and fully supported prohibition. Drugs were seen as being behind all that's bad in society. This gave them a \"righteousness\" in their actions, observed Bacon. But within this, recreational drug users, social dealers, and nightclubs were far less of a crime problem than alcohol, a drug which few officers had a problem with.", "It's perhaps not surprising, given the police's moral code, that most of the officers he hung around with viewed \"junkies\" as lazy, undeserving scumbags. In 2012, a former undercover officer who disguised himself as a heroin user-dealer, told me: \"It made me realize how bad cops can be to drug addicts. I was abused, assaulted, and threatened with being fitted up by having drugs planted on me on a regular basis.\"", "To the anti-drug teams Bacon shadowed, heroin dealers were one of the most despised groups in society, so much so that they were seen as \"police property\"—objects that police could do with as they wished. \"Almost without exception, dealers were depicted as deplorable and dangerous outlaws,\" says Bacon. \"They were made the scapegoat of the drug problem.\"", " Photo: Marco Tulio Valencia", "Drug cops, who saw themselves as \"elite crime fighters,\" had sufficient respect however for the the Mr. Bigs of the drug world. They saw those who ran professional outfits and had families at home as worthy adversaries, and a \"good collar\" for which they would earn respect among their colleagues.", "Despite all this, there was acceptance—often expressed by officers off-duty after a few pints—that they were not waging a \"war on drugs,\" but managing an unbeatable problem in order to \"keep the public happy.\"", "One detective sergeant told Bacon: \"Sometimes I think we're like those [Japanese] soldiers in World War II—you know, those ones on the island who just kept fighting because they didn't know the war was over. Only difference is, we'd lost the war before we even started fighting.\" Another officer told him: \"We've thrown everything at it, even the kitchen sink, but drug problems just keep getting worse. In the end, the drugs are still on the streets, no matter how many people we lock up.\"", "There are rebellious notions even among the rank and file. When I went stop and searching in Soho with one of the Met Police's sniffer dog teams in 2013, I was surprised to hear from a regular beat officer and his colleague that they thought cannabis should be legalized entirely. \"I say legalize the lot,\" one said. \"Legalize it and tax it,\" said the other. \"If someone wants to turn the sky green and the grass blue, then it's up to them. I can't see the difference between alcohol and cannabis. The official line is that drugs are under control, but they are not.\"", "I call up Simon Kempton, a police sergeant from Dorset who has specialized in drug enforcement and sits on the National Board of the Police Federation, a body that represents rank and file officers. He agrees with Woods—that the drug trade houses the most violent people in the country—but believes prohibition is crucial to taking them out.", "\"I can't speak for everyone, but in my opinion drug policing is worthwhile, all day, every day,\" he says. \"I get it: it can seem futile when we take out someone knocking out kilos of cocaine, [who's] replaced within two hours. But the reason it's worth doing is because the drug is not just about the drug trade: it's weapons, terrorism, people trafficking, money laundering; it straddles the spectrum of the most serious crimes, such as murder, kidnapping, serious assault—which all go hand in hand with the drug trade.", "\"We are taking out the worst people in our society. When they assault people it's not just a punch-up outside a pub; we are talking about sending a message through retribution and torture. These people have to protect their trade from others, so they use extreme levels of violence. You have to be the scariest, biggest person on the block, otherwise they will take your money from you.", "\"Undercover police officers would not take the huge risks infiltrating gangs if they did not think it was worthwhile. Undercover drug policing is not cheap, but it's very cost effective. It's rare to get a not guilty after undercover work because of all the evidence that's been gathered. Yes, people can feel demoralized that they've put themselves on the line, and then someone ends up getting just a coupe of years, but that's the way it is sometimes.\"", "However, Sgt Kempton said that for rank and file officers, policing cannabis was another matter, and that many officers sympathized with the path taken by Durham Police in going easy on low-level cannabis offenses : \"With dwindling resources, forces are having to focus their limited numbers on areas which represent the greatest harms to wider society. While policing cannabis is still a legitimate action, I believe most officers and the public would support a focus on other areas of crime.\"", "Over the years writing about the drug trade, I've met drug cops who have told me that their job is similar to that of the drug user or trafficker—a series of almost addictive drug bust \"hits\" that perpetuate the game. There are some who have crossed the line completely to become dependent drug users themselves, and others who are disgusted by the stigmatization of drug users and even dealers.", "One female drug cop I spoke to told me: \"There are some pretty nasty pieces of work out there, but some of them are just ordinary people. Behind every user and runner, there's a story,\" she said. \"A lot of people say drug addicts and drug dealers are scum of the earth, but they don't know anything about them.\"", "Woods' book will open the public's eyes to the raw violence and canniness of the drug world, and the lengths police will go to in order to disrupt it. But after years fighting at the apex of the drug war, his conclusion—and that of other experienced officers who have chosen to speak out—must be heeded if we want to find a solution to a problem that has been trashing communities around the world for decades."], "targetTitle": "British Police Officers Reveal What They Really Think About the War on Drugs", "targetDescription": "\"Sometimes I think we're like those Japanese soldiers in WWII—the ones on the island who just kept fighting because they didn't know the war was over.\"", "targetKeywords": "drugs, war on drugs, good cop bad war, neil woods, Narcomania, Max Daly, post-regular, news-cycle, news, crime, drug use, drug dealers, drug gangs, arrests, cops, police, VICE UK, Good Cop, Bad War", "targetMedia": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMzMzP///yH5BAAHAP8ALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/62f27bdd707fece1e17f8ae592aa45d9f3ce7741", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/973fcca06ce211fda31c16f10edc45938107321c", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/6bf69332854b92bf8dc89ca55748497d020e1a7f", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/b339c3f782f6875f34c781c0a8cb29e3b6c52848", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/ba18220d67ea21f9705acd66f2578e9d5238b3b1", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/4bf3918fde90c04032102bf2a49c64c94f45d14c/scr.png", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/929ca28647309f2278330481aab2ce1ebeca0472", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/f6fe1180681774fe491bc303d7334a7c4722398c", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/a1236612a14ffb4c5b1f4be4d8dab457552dc08a", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAMAAAAoLQ9TAAABU1BMVEUAAAABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALCwsfHx8dHR0ICAgCAgIVFRUSEhISEhIODg5TU1MFBQUCAgIDAwNJSUkTExMEBAQHBwcICAgEBAQMDAwCAgJZWVk5OTkKCgoUFBQhISEODg4KCgoAAAANDQ0MDAwCAgIBAQEjIyMCAgIvLy8AAAAVFRUPDw8ODg4QEBAAAAAKCgovLy8qKioKCgoTExMAAAASEhIODg4EBAQAAAAFBQUKCgoKCgoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABcXFwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEBAAAAAeHh4AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAgIoKCgkJCQNDQ12dnYSEhIdHR0lJSUmJiYwMDAUFBQZGRkKCgpiYmKCFFTcAAAAYnRSTlMAAAQCB+9A/gFZYMtZCwADOK7fSgEA9k8APVM3pCfZpCenzKzqGgAAABHgJpHABxMZeE4k4epZw4I8eK5zAF1oSfMhmf7HKzGF1tO0RzIxna+4zTUDJecM4KyL0GEQw2Xe1BogW7kAAAC/SURBVHheNY1Tg8RAEAY7yWZt2zbOtm2jszji/3OnZy710l/VSwOjGQbCYrPTkSRrMuWQ2Mp85ig4Xd7Rn3uRLZ+nRiHgr28EQ3IkGosnQGA+Sp9kB+/f+YLwYqlcqfZ/fjVsGHhotaHz8aYho0vem5icmh4iZ4bC7Fd/bh4FCxSUpWVYEb66BvqfdXLT5ta2rKed3b39g0PVdKxwNZ6enV8AXCJe8c/XN4i37Mp39w9APKqIT3wpIHh+eTXCP2MHbSZMouN0pwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAA1BMVEVMaXFNx9g6AAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEHAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/b664433987a80ba8a8dc941a740a61a7e5f7c5df", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/44fe84504b952902bc353ffc1a5d639356f3326e.png", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/575af6c93490090d6c82ae7bdf49899b9c4a578f", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/2949b83aa1d8998687db5a22494691d3f2b3173b", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/abc27b61515a6da9b226f2f2b597c8eaec3b2fe8", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/9ebe9b7ec3d663a5816dc45402bd441e872b5cfa", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/ddc84d91a0e5657ead0073c98070291ba56f8bd4", "https://archive.is/gxCxd/0fe354f1cc3db115d4c7d046753c26407c9b221e"], "targetUrl": "https://archive.is/gxCxd", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "They don't think it's effective or reasonable.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["The logic of the drugs war only leads one way: the police get smarter, so the criminals get nastier"], "spoilerPositions": [[[3, 1], [3, 100]]], "tags": ["passage"]}

After all, they are grandiose and self-righteous in a way that only a person with great power and questionable taste could truly appreciate.

Consequently, homosexuals certainly aren't fit to hang such a blessed and holy fixture in a stage production where faggotry and fabulousness are main themes.", "As we prepare to open our production of God Hates This Show: Shirley Phelps-Roper in Concert Live From Hell in New York City next month, we've been on the prowl for set dressings and items befitting a cabaret room located in the pits of Hell -- the setting of our play, which imagines the Westboro Baptist Church and Shirley Phelps-Roper having been damned to the underworld for all eternity.", "It seemed that an elaborate (read: gaudy) chandelier, preferably red in color, should hang dramatically over the live rock band that is part of the show. Our hunt led us to the lovely, Christian businesspeople at Ivory & Deene. Impressed by the ornate lighting fixtures and reasonable prices, we decided to contact the management to see if we could negotiate a discounted price, as our theater company is a nonprofit with a very limited budget. What did we have to lose? We thought that the worst thing they could say was \"no,\" but it turns out that that's not the worst thing they could say. Here's what they did say to our producer Will:", "We are sorry we will not support your production because we are Christians and we believe the first marriage God instigated was between and [sic] man and a woman and when he created them he said \"very good\", not just \"good\" like He did with the rest of creation, but \"very good\". Mankind has moved so far from the way God intended us to live, we must return to God's way of living, it is the best way and the blessed way, hope you can understand. Kind regards, Ruby", "Punctuation, spelling, and grammar aside, Ruby obviously intended to make an example of us by denying us an item that surely only a homosexual would dream of purchasing anyway. (If you saw the chandelier, you'd understand.) She seemed intent on reaffirming her archaic and unfounded belief system by misquoting the Bible. (God did not say \"very good\" when he created man and woman. Look it up.) And rather than simply declining our request, as so many companies we have sought sponsorship from have, Ruby decided to do the least Christian thing she could think of: directly and personally judge and shame strangers. She may not have called us \"faggots,\" but she might as well have.", "I worry about Ruby. She seems to be oblivious to the fact that a great deal of her clientele are most likely queer. I mean, come on. Girl is selling amazing satin sheets. Whether she knows it or not, Ruby is singlehandedly contributing to the decoration of bedrooms where abominations unimaginable occur. We're screwing on your sheet sets, Ruby. And in a way, a little part of you is screwing right along with us. Just thought you'd like to know. You're gay by association. Find a shower. Quick.", "The truth is, Ruby can't be naïve enough to think that she has never sold a product to a gay person. But the anonymity of the marketplace and the exchange of money for goods is all it takes for Ruby and Ivory & Deene to turn their heads the other way. Only when directly presented with the truth do they suddenly take issue.", "Perhaps we'll directly and anonymously purchase the chandelier from Ruby and hang it proudly on our set. I also have a full page of ad space that I don't know what to do with. Maybe this:", "The chandelier in tonight's performance comes from Ivory & Deene's collection of exquisite heteronormative lighting. To find out if you yourself are fit to own these fine straight-people products, ask yourself this: \"Do I like gay sex?\"", "This question might also help you determine whether or not you'll dig our show.

Cohn noted that the GOP nominee is viewed as fundamentally unfit for the job by an unusually large percentage of Republican voters, perhaps creating unique complications in the quest to unify them.", "\"Many Republican voters have an unfavorable impression of him — worse still, many don’t even think he has the knowledge, temperament or qualifications to be president,\" Cohn wrote. \"If Mr. Trump can’t reunify Republican-leaning voters, Mrs. Clinton really could win in a landslide.\"", "Speaking in Warren, Mich., on Aug. 11, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton outlined her vision for the U.S. economy. (The Washington Post)", "Today brings new polling that suggests these conditions may indeed may taking shape.", "The new NBC News/Survey Monkey Tracking Poll finds Clinton leading Trump among registered voters nationally by 50-41. Even more crucially, Clinton is demolishing Trump on the question of who has the right personality and temperament to be president: 42 percent of voters say Clinton does, versus only 17 percent who say Trump does.", "But note Trump’s numbers among Republicans on the temperament question:", "Fewer than one in five Republicans believe Trump has the right personality and temperament to serve as president. (By contrast, 39 percent of Democrats say that about Clinton.) Now, this is only one poll, and the temperament numbers for both candidates were perhaps driven downward by the question wording, which did not poll each individual trait in a separate question, instead asking respondents to pick all the traits that apply.", "But this general finding shows up in other polls, too. A recent Washington Post/ABC News survey found that a surprisingly high 23 percent of Republicans agreed that Trump is \"not qualified to serve as president,\" while 74 percent said he is qualified. Among all adults, 61 percent said Trump is not qualified. Meanwhile, the Post/ABC poll also found that a staggering 34 percent of Republicans say Trump does not have the right kind of personality and temperament to serve effectively as president, while 67 percent of overall Americans said the same. For Clinton, the percentages of Democrats who said she was unfit for the job by both those metrics was in single digits, while large majorities of overall adults gave her the thumbs-up on them.", "This basic imbalance is one of the under-appreciated narratives of this race. It regularly gets lost amid claims that both candidates are historically disliked. While this is true, the underlying and arguably more important story is that in spite of this, only one of the two candidates is widely seen as fundamentally prepared and qualified for the presidency, while the other is widely seen as unprepared and lacking in the basic qualities required for it. And this core imbalance goes deeper: Only one of them is seen as unfit by surprisingly large percentages of voters from his or her own party.", "To be clear, Trump could obviously still win this race or make it very close, if he succeeds in uniting Republican voters in the home stretch. It seems very likely to tighten. External events or new Clinton revelations could still shake things up. But the conventions are over, and the Clinton team — operating with a candidate with very real weaknesses of her own — appears to be well on its way towards accomplishing its goal of making this election all about Trump’s increasingly obvious temperamental unfitness and lack of qualifications for the job.

The kind of relentless attacks on the Islamic State he advocates — along with taking and holding the oil fields, which may well be a violation of international law — would require a considerable presence by American troops or their allies, and foreign bases to launch the drones.", "Trump’s promise is basically to promise to crush the terrorist enemy while vowing no messy entanglements abroad. It’s a scam.", "* TRUMP’S POLICY GIBBERISH: Trump is now proposing to impose a new ideological test on those trying to enter the country from areas scarred by terrorism. CNN analyst Peter Bergen explains why the idea is half baked at best:", "This seems unworkable. For example, would anyone sitting for these tests volunteer that they had secret proclivities for jihadist terrorism? Also, Trump didn’t specify what countries would be affected by this new test. But France has a serious domestic terrorism problem — would French citizens be subjected to this kind of test?...In short, Trump didn’t say who would be targeted for these ideological tests, saying only that he would consult the State Department about how to approach this issue.", "The idea is really an effort to repackage Trump’s Muslim ban as somehow being in sync with American values.", "* TRUMP’S BIG LIE ABOUT ISIS: Trump continues to claim (as he did in his speech yesterday) that Obama policies were the chief cause of ISIS.

(To support his claim, he points, in part, to the show's lack of an audience in Russia.)", "To some degree, this is true. Back when the series debuted, the media wrote about Mad Men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings. The first season's viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times — a much more perilous event in an age when DVRs and streaming services were less prevalent. But by season two, the awards and critical attention Mad Men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels, and even if the show was never a smash hit, it had a long, healthy run.", "Still, there are a bunch of good, mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep, in Idov's words, shoving Mad Men down readers' throats. Here are five.", "1) Readers wanted to read about it", "In my pre-Vox life, I was the TV editor of The A.V. Club, a position that gave me unique insight into what sorts of TV content readers wanted to consume. And every time we wrote about Mad Men, those numbers spiked. The show was consistently among the top five series we wrote about in terms of readership, and a well-timed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up.", "The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle", "This has carried right over to Vox. We write a lot about the show because there's a huge audience out there ready to devour Mad Men content — far beyond any other show I've written about here that's not Game of Thrones. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle.", "Yes, the huge explosion of commentary in the days preceding the show's finale was driven by how much many of us in the media liked the show. But it was also driven by the fact that our readers wanted to see this sort of material. Some of that was an accident of timing.", "2) Mad Men debuted right after The Sopranos ended and filled the void the show left", "When Mad Men began, in the summer of 2007, The Sopranos had ended just a few weeks before. The Wire (never as popular in terms of raw readership numbers, though no slouch itself) would end in early 2008. Lost was the king of the recap roost at the time, but those who wrote about it usually focused more on grand, unified theories of why the show worked, rather than the sorts of symbolic interpretations The Sopranos invited.", "Mad Men also benefitted from the rise of TV recapping in general", "Thus, there was a huge opening in the \"reading about TV on the internet\" marketplace that was beginning to boom in the late 2000s, and Mad Men filled it as surely as it filled the slots vacated by Sopranos at the Golden Globes and the Emmys. The two shows' thematic concerns, use of dreamlike imagery, and storytelling structure were incredibly similar, which only helped matters.", "But Mad Men also benefited from the rise of TV recapping in general. Alan Sepinwall began his seminal blog What's Alan Watching in late 2005, and by that final Sopranos season, dozens of publications were dipping their toes into the recap waters. That number would explode in years to come — and Mad Men was a natural fit for publications that wanted to write TV recaps and people who wanted to read them.", "3) There just wasn't as much good TV on", "When Mad Men started, it was popular to suggest that the end of The Sopranos, the cancellation of HBO's Deadwood, and the impending end of The Wire signaled the end of TV's Golden Age. (Sound familiar?) Instead, Mad Men and later Breaking Bad picked up that ball and ran with it, while FX entered the early stages of a hot streak that continues to this day.", "But, really, in that summer of 2007, the established shows worth writing about were few and far between — especially if you didn't want to publish weekly, in-depth reviews of comedies (a later development, largely driven by content-hungry sites like, well, The A.V. Club). They were essentially limited to The Wire, Dexter, Lost, Heroes, 24, Grey's Anatomy, and maybe Veronica Mars (if your readership was especially young). Thus, it was easy to get the \"serious TV\" audience to tune in to Mad Men, because there weren't a ton of other options.", "Mad Men suggested every cable channel should have its own scripted drama series in development — and now they pretty much all do", "Contrast that to today, when a show like The Americans can't get the same sort of readership traction as Mad Men (even though it has a loyal, dedicated audience that likes reading about it), simply because there's so much more stuff out there. This most recent season of that FX drama received the kind of acclaim Mad Men did in its heyday — but it's much, much harder for a series to cut through the noise from all those other shows out there. Mad Men suggested every single cable channel should have its own scripted drama in development — and now they pretty much all do.", "4) Mad Men was actually pretty popular, when all was said and done", "Though it never pulled in Big Bang Theory numbers, AMC told Vulture's Joe Adalian that at the show's height, a total of just under 7 million people watched it. That number's not insignificant, and even a tiny percentage of that audience consistently reading pieces about the show online would be more than enough to drive significant traffic to most websites — especially back in 2007, when the overall online readership was smaller.", "5) Never underestimate passion", "As my colleague Matthew Yglesias wrote about the popularity of Bernie Sanders' presidential candidacy online, a small but rabidly passionate audience for a particular topic can be lifeblood to a website that craves readers. What holds true for Sanders is also true for Mad Men: there are very few casual Mad Men fans. And those passionate fans tend to seek out everything they can find about the show.", "Early on, the media positioned Mad Men as a sort of lifestyle choice", "The media is, of course, at least somewhat complicit in this. Early on, we positioned the series as a sort of lifestyle choice — if you were cool, you would watch Mad Men. But TV sites have said that about a lot of shows over the years, and few of them held up, readership-wise, as well as Mad Men did. (Whither Boardwalk Empire?) Yes, the early push might have been a bit much, but Mad Men ended up having the goods — at least for the people who cared about it.", "I agree with the theoretical concerns behind the criticisms of media coverage of Mad Men.

The answer is obvious."], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["Last summer, a black real estate developer and reality television show host — let’s call him Donell Trump — announced his candidacy for president of the United States. A notorious adulterer, Donell Trump has fathered five children with three different wives. Over decades in the media spotlight, he has insulted a slew of women by calling them, among many other slurs, \"fat,\" \"ugly\" and \"pigs\"; he told one female journalist she had \"the face of a dog.\"", "Once the proprietor of a global beauty pageant, whose contestants he routinely demeaned, Donell Trump is obsessed with boasting about his sexual prowess. He joked about the size of his anatomy during a live televised debate and riffed about dating his adult daughter. If Donell Trump’s attitude toward the fairer sex could be distilled into a single sentence, it’s what he told Esquire in 1991: \"It really doesn’t matter what [the media] write about you as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\"", "Then there’s money. Donell Trump can’t get enough of it. He’s obsessed with ostentatious displays of wealth. Donell Trump constantly exaggerates his personal net worth, and his larger-than-life existence — shiny watches, fast cars, big yachts, massive cribs — resembles that of a rap star. A substantial part of his fortune was made through shady business ventures that took advantage of working-class people, but Donell Trump has no apologies.", "Donell Trump also displays rank ignorance about every single political issue he’s asked about, speaks at a fifth-grade reading level, and has trouble forming grammatically correct sentences. He routinely nudges attendees at his rallies to beat up protestors, has boasted that he could shoot someone on Manhattan’s 5th Avenue to prove his voters’ loyalty to him, and has dropped hints that his supporters should kill his opponent.", "Presented with such a presidential candidate — one who seemingly went out of his way to personify every negative stereotype our society holds about black male sexuality, avarice and propensity to violence — how would the Republican Party base and conservative entertainment industry respond? Would Bill O’Reilly and Jerry Falwell Jr. praise Donell Trump as a model American businessman and moral leader? Or would they lament how this habitual homewrecker and \"baby daddy\" to three separate women symbolized the epidemic of African American absentee fatherhood? Would Rush Limbaugh insist that Donell Trump’s half-literate tirades were the heartfelt pleas of a down-to-earth, blue-collar billionaire? Or instead treat his listeners to a rant about the inanities of Ebonics?", "\" A racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. f t", "In a sense, we already know how this segment of the right would respond to such a hypothetical black politician, given the way they've treated President Obama. An intellectual, Ivy League-educated, cool-tempered family man, Obama has nevertheless been portrayed by much of the right-wing media as nothing short of the anti-Christ, a crypto-Muslim Manchurian candidate secretly plotting to destroy America. Meanwhile, many of the same people who claim with a straight face that the plagiarizing former nude model Melania Trump would make an ideal first lady slam Michelle Obama’s innocuous healthy-eating initiative as nothing less than a Maoist reeducation scheme.", "Granted, if conservatives rejected Donell Trump as unfit for office, they wouldn’t be in the wrong. The values Donell Trump exemplifies — pride, greed, envy, a literal catalog of the seven deadly sins — are ones we ought to recoil from when choosing a president.", "My point is that the very voters and media personalities who would almost certainly condemn Donell have embraced Donald, which indicates the degree to which a racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. Replace the outer-borough white ethnic vulgarity with African American ghetto vernacular and they’d call the man a \"thug.\"", "Some conservatives may respond to this thought exercise by claiming that, actually, Republican voters would enthusiastically welcome a black candidate, a Donell Trump — so long as he, too, championed nationalist, politically incorrect, anti-immigrant populism. But the closest the GOP ever had to a black Trump, 2012 contender Herman Cain, fizzled out as soon as sexual harassment allegations against him became public.", "Moreover, so much of Donald Trump’s popularity is based on unsubtle appeals to white nationalism that — despite the thought exercise above — it’s impossible to imagine a true black analogue. Trump’s hesitance to condemn David Duke, his \"law and order\" mantra evocative of Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy, and his conspiracy theories about the president’s birth certificate are all intended to whip up white racial resentment.", "Which brings us to the crux of the matter: Whether the subject is poverty, police brutality or affirmative action, conservatives are loath to acknowledge the presence of racism in American society.

Still, it would be remiss of us not to point out how big the Chilis’ crowd is tonight: it feels twice as large as Biffy’s or Disclosure’s.The frontman doesn’t say much tonight - Flea, as usual, does most of the talking - but when he does open his mouth, it’s to share this nugget of wisdom with us: \"All these firefighters and they don't know how to put out a flare/ Shit, it's hard to breathe, might set fire to your pubic hair/ I might have to do a WWE into that table full of drinks down there.\" Um, thanks for that, Anthony.", "The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ drummer is a 54 year-old man who’s never worn a baseball cap the right way round, and he remains this band’s resident badass. There’s no way any group featuring this guy is the worst one in the universe.", "It’s a Red Hot Chili Peppers show; you make allowances for gratuitous slap bass. At times, however, it feels like every spare moment is filled with Flea’s fiddling, and it never fails to grate on your nerves. A useful gauge during these moments is to look around and see who looks like they’re having more fun, him or the crowd. Guess what the answer is.Of the many, many former members of RHCP, you could argue that ex-guitarist John Frusciante was – even more so than founding member Hillel Slovak – the only irreplaceable one. Yet Josh Klinghoffer, the man tasked with filling Frusciante’s shoes, is proving a more than capable substitute. Frusciante is still missed – Keidis recently said of him that, \"Never did I meet someone who was so easy to write songs with\" – but Klinghoffer is making the role his own.", "The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been together for over thirty years, and the fact that they haven’t completely succumbed to the power of nostalgia is admirable. Even so, it’s fair to say that songs like ‘Dark Necessities’ and ’Go Robot’ - both taken from the band’s new album, ‘The Getaway’ - are tolerated, rather than celebrated, tonight.", "Say what you will about the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but any band packing a tune as glorious as ‘Under The Bridge’ don’t deserve the scorn of Fox News. You might have heard their signature track a thousand times before, but it never sounds overplayed – unlike, say, set-closer ‘Give It Away’.", "Look, it’s no small thing to be the worst band in the universe. This is a universe, after all, in which Nickelback, Limp Bizkit and The Pigeon Detectives all exist on the same planet.

They can even be found in saliva, feces and urine, which could explain how the disease is spreading so quickly among wild deer and elk.", "The CDC is working with public health authorities in Wyoming and Colorado to monitor hunters for signs of prion disease.", "\"Unfortunately, because these diseases have long incubation periods, it's not easy to monitor transmission,\" says Belay.

The tweet, which I’ll paraphrase, said that people who listen to rappers like Kodak Black, Migos, Young Thug, Future, Fetty Wap, and Lil Yachty are people who subsequently have low IQs. This isn’t exactly an unfamiliar comment that can be found online. I’ve seen tweets before that have told me that I’m stupid for listening to more Fetty Wap songs than Tupac songs in the past year. I’m not a real hip hop fan, apparently. There are a couple points I want to get to about these sorts of popular, conformist opinions.", "First of all, the digital era and internet presence of hip hop has made the genre as inclusive a community as I’ve ever seen it. Chance the Rapper made Free (Based Freestyles Mixtape) with Lil B. Mac Miller has a song with Chief Keef on his last album, GO:OD AM. Andre 3000 dropped a lengthy verse on \"Sixteen,\" a song off of Rick Ross’ God Forgives, I Don’t. What haven’t 2 Chainz and Thugger not been featured on this decade?

Your favorite, thoughtful, wordy rapper could put out a song with your least favorite, struggle-bar spitting rapper. It’s only a matter of time before it happens (unless it already has).", "So if a rapper like Danny Brown wants to hop on the remix for SD’s \"New World Order\" (as he did), does that mean that Danny Brown has a low IQ? Or even, does SD have a low IQ for rapping repetitive and simplistic lyrics in a sub-genre of rap (drill) that almost depends on recycling lyrics/themes? The answer to both questions is no. Therefore, it doesn’t matter if someone’s favorite rapper is Kodak Black or Kendrick Lamar—it doesn’t in any way reflect someone’s intelligence.", "Now, I can’t really speak on the actual IQ numbers of the people I know, but I can say with confidence that I know a lot of very intelligent people who like rappers who aren’t considered lyrical rappers. My sister, who does have a gifted-level IQ, has become a big Future fan. One of my college roommates frequently listens to Migos, and he will be attending law school next fall. My girlfriend, who is an award-winning writer, and who could run laps around most people with her expert grasp of language, gets hype to Flocka like none other. My favorite hip hop project of the year (if I’m not considering the force that is Death Grips’ Bottomless Pit a rap album, which I’m not) is Lil Yachty’s Lil Boat mixtape, and I just graduated from my liberal arts college with departmental honors. And I think \"Minnesota (Remix),\" which ironically features Quavo of Migos and Young Thug, is one of the most fun hip hop songs I’ve heard all year. People with any level of intelligence are free to like any kind of music they want to. What’s wrong with putting Kodak Black’s \"SKRT\" and Kendrick Lamar’s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\" on the same playlist?", "In fact, there’s nothing wrong with liking both Kodak Black and Kendrick Lamar. Speaking of Kendrick Lamar, I have a friend who told me once that Machine Gun Kelly was a better artist than Kendrick. Sure, I cringed and adamantly disagreed, but ultimately it didn’t make a difference what I thought. It’s never cool to make someone feel bad for what they like or love, even if the music they like might be unpopular, weird, or bad to you. It’s twice as lame to post on social media how terrible certain rappers are (rappers who could care less about the opinions of fans who they aren’t trying to attract anyway) and even worse to trash the innocent fans of these rappers.", "There will always be pretentiousness when it comes to any kind of art. I’m guilty of it as much as I’m sure a lot of people are. But opinions on hip hop are subjective. It’s important to be open-minded. There are so many unique sub-genres of rap that are waiting to be explored that may not rely on lyrics, poetry, or message as much as maybe the sound, vocal delivery, or overall aesthetic. There’s a reason Common isn’t ever requested at the bar. I don’t hear A Tribe Called Quest during warmups for big basketball games.

It was 2005, and my mother had reached the end of treatments for metastatic breast cancer. A month or two earlier, she’d been able to take the dog for daily walks in the mountains and travel to Australia with my father. Now, she was weak, exhausted from the disease and chemotherapy and pain medication. My mother had been the one to decide, with her doctor’s blessing, to stop pursuing the dwindling chemo options, and she had been the one to ask her doctor to call hospice. Still, we weren’t prepared for the nurse’s question. My mother and I exchanged glances, a little shocked. But what we felt most was a sense of relief. During six-and-a-half years of treatment, although my mother saw two general practitioners, six oncologists, a cardiologist, several radiation technicians, nurses at two chemotherapy facilities, and surgeons at three different clinics—not once, to my knowledge, had anyone talked to her about what would happen as she died.", "There’s good reason. \"Roughly from the last two weeks until the last breath, somewhere in that interval, people become too sick, or too drowsy, or too unconscious, to tell us what they’re experiencing,\" says Margaret Campbell, a professor of nursing at Wayne State University who has worked in palliative care for decades. The way death is talked about tends to be based on what family, friends, and medical professionals see, rather than accounts of what dying actually feels like. James Hallenbeck, a palliative-care specialist at Stanford University, often compares dying to black holes. \"We can see the effect of black holes, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to look inside them. They exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one gets to them. As one passes the ‘event horizon,’ apparently the laws of physics begin to change.\" What does dying feel like? Despite a growing body of research about death, the actual, physical experience of dying—the last few days or moments—remains shrouded in mystery. Medicine is just beginning to peek beyond the horizon. * * * Until about 100 years ago, almost all dying happened quickly. But modern medicine has radically changed how long the end of life can be stretched. Now, Americans who have access to medical care often die gradually, of lingering diseases like most terminal cancers or complications from diabetes or dementia, rather than quickly from, say, a farm accident or the flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control’s most recent figures, Americans are most likely to die of heart disease, cancer, or chronic pulmonary lung disease. \"Pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness.\" For those who do die gradually, there’s often a final, rapid slide that happens in roughly the last few days of life—a phase known as \"active dying.\" During this time, Hallenbeck writes in Palliative Care Perspectives, his guide to palliative care for physicians, people tend to lose their senses and desires in a certain order. \"First hunger and then thirst are lost. Speech is lost next, followed by vision. The last senses to go are usually hearing and touch.\"", "Whether dying is physically painful, or how painful it is, appears to vary. \"There are some kinds of conditions where pain is inevitable,\" Campbell says. \"There are some patients that just get really, really old and just fade away, and there’s no distress.\" Having a disease associated with pain doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily endure a difficult death, either. Most people dying of cancer need pain medication to keep them comfortable, Campbell notes—and the medicine usually works. \"If they’re getting a good, comprehensive pain regimen, they can die peacefully,\" she says. When people become too weak to cough or swallow, some start to make a noise in the backs of their throats. The sound can be deeply disturbing, as if the patient is suffering. But that’s not what it feels like to the person dying, as far as doctors can tell. In fact, medical researchers believe that the phenomenon—which is commonly called a death rattle—probably doesn’t hurt. Ultimately, because most people lose awareness or consciousness in their last few hours or days, it’s hard to know for certain how much patients are suffering. \"We generally believe that if your brain is really in a comatose kind of situation, or you’re not really responsive, that your perception—how you feel about things—may also be significantly decreased,\" says David Hui, an oncologist and palliative-care specialist who researches the signs of approaching death. \"You may or may not even be aware of what’s happening.\"", "* * * A week or two after we spoke to the nurse, my mother sank into a state where she was rarely conscious. When she was awake, it was only the most basic part of her that was there: the part that told her legs to move to get her to the bathroom, the automated steps in brushing her teeth and then wiping the sink afterward. Her mind turned away from her children and husband for the first time. I wanted to know what she was thinking about. I wanted to know where her mind was. Being at the bedside of an unresponsive dying person can feel like trying to find out whether someone is home by looking through thick-curtained windows. Is the person sleeping, dreaming, experiencing something supernatural? Is her mind gone? For many dying people, \"the brain does the same thing that the body does in that it starts to sacrifice areas which are less critical to survival,\" says David Hovda, director of the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center. He compares the breakdown to what happens in aging: People tend to lose their abilities for complex or executive planning, learning motor skills—and, in what turns out to be a very important function, inhibition. \"The waves get higher and higher, and eventually, they carry the person out to sea.\" \"As the brain begins to change and start to die, different parts become excited, and one of the parts that becomes excited is the visual system,\" Hovda explains. \"And so that’s where people begin to see light.\"", "Recent research points to evidence that the sharpening of the senses some people report also seems to match what we know about the brain’s response to dying. Jimo Borjigin, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, first became intrigued by this subject when she noticed something strange in the brains of animals in another experiment: Just before the animals died, neurochemicals in the brain suddenly surged. While scientists had known that brain neurons continued to fire after a person died, this was different. The neurons were secreting new chemicals, and in large amounts. \"A lot of cardiac-arrest survivors describe that during their unconscious period, they have this amazing experience in their brain,\" she says. \"They see lights and then they describe the experience as ‘realer than real.’\" She realized the sudden release of neurochemicals might help to explain this feeling. Borjigin and her research team tried an experiment. They anesthetized eight rats, and then stopped their hearts. \"Suddenly, all the different regions of the brain became synchronized,\" she says. The rats’ brains showed higher power in different frequency waves, and also what is known as coherence—the electrical activity from different parts of the brain working together. \"If you’re focusing attention, doing something, trying to figure out a word or trying to remember a face—when you’re doing high-level cognitive activity, these features go up,\" Borjigin says. \"These are well-used parameters in studying human consciousness in awake humans. So, we thought, if you’re alert or aroused, similar parameters should also go up in the dying brain. In fact, that was the case.\"", "* * * In her last couple of weeks, when my mother’s mind seemed to be floating off somewhere else most of the time, she would sometimes lift her arms into the air, plucking at invisible objects with her fingers. Once, I captured her hands in mine and asked what she’d been doing. \"Putting things away,\" she answered, smiling dreamily. This half-dreaming, half-waking state is common in dying people. In fact, researchers led by Christopher Kerr at a hospice center outside Buffalo, New York, conducted a study of dying people’s dreams. Most of the patients interviewed, 88 percent, had at least one dream or vision. And those dreams usually felt different to them from normal dreams. For one thing, the dreams seemed clearer, more real. The \"patients’ pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness and the dying often experienced them as waking reality,\" the researchers write in the Journal of Palliative Medicine. Seventy-two percent of the patients dreamed about reuniting with people who had already died. Fifty-nine percent said they dreamed about getting ready to travel somewhere. Twenty-eight percent dreamed about meaningful experiences in the past. (Patients were interviewed every day, so the same people often reported dreams about multiple subjects.) For most of the patients, the dreams were comforting and positive. The researchers say the dreams often helped decrease the fear of death. \"The predominant quality of pre-death dreams/visions was a sense of personal meaning, which frequently carried emotional significance for the patient,\" they report."], "targetTitle": "What It Feels Like to Die", "targetDescription": "Science is just beginning to understand the experience of life’s end.", "targetKeywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "targetMedia": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20160915095411im_/http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.22--NS/0", "http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wm_tb_prv_on.png", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/09/AP_552393088335/facebook.jpg?1473429504", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160915095411im_/http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.23.6--NS/0", "http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wm_tb_nxt_on.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160915095411im_/https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/09/AP_552393088335/lead_960.jpg?1473429504", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160915095411im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-b0K-eQJGBXxXE.gif", "http://web.archive.org/web/jsp/graph.jsp?graphdata=550_27_1996:-1:000000000000_1997:-1:000000000000_1998:-1:000000000000_1999:-1:000000000000_2000:-1:000000000000_2001:-1:000000000000_2002:-1:000000000000_2003:-1:000000000000_2004:-1:000000000000_2005:-1:000000000000_2006:-1:000000000000_2007:-1:000000000000_2008:-1:000000000000_2009:-1:000000000000_2010:-1:000000000000_2011:-1:000000000000_2012:-1:000000000000_2013:-1:000000000000_2014:-1:000000000000_2015:-1:000000000000_2016:8:00000000b011_2017:-1:000000000000", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160915095411im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6463921&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160915095411im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1407501962855831&ev=NoScript", "http://web.archive.org/static/images/toolbar/wayback-toolbar-logo.png", "http://web.archive.org/web/20160915095411im_/http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-906344h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript"], "targetUrl": "http://web.archive.org/web/20160915095411/http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/09/what-it-feels-like-to-die/499319/", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "it \"remains shrouded in mystery.\"", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["from the last two weeks until the last breath, somewhere in that interval, people become too sick, or too drowsy, or too unconscious, to tell us what they’re experiencing", "Pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness.", "First hunger and then thirst are lost.

By transferring our minds into machines we could live forever, unmoored from the feebleness of our physical bodies. The concepts of death and bereavement as we know them now would cease to exist.", "Currently the idea lives within whitepapers and sci-fi movies, and the only thing (most) researchers agree on is that it won't be possible for a really long time. But while we're far from achieving that pinnacle of immorality, technology in the here-and-now has already started giving us a sliver of eternal life while shaping how we grieve our loved ones if and when they die.", "The Silicon Valley-startup Eterni.me aims to let people preserve their \"most important thoughts, stories, and memories\" in an artificially intelligent system that could ultimately communicate conversationally with others once its creator is gone. Such an avatar could both soothe the bereaved and allow future generations to know much more about their great-great-grandparents.", "Since the company had a splashy launch two years ago it has progressed with crypt-like quietness. Their site is mostly unchanged, save for the counter of people signed up for early access that rises each day. But now it says it plans to launch revamped version of its app to a test group in early 2017. The app will connect to a person's Facebook account (with other social integration planned) and launch micro-conversations based on their daily activities. Ultimately that process will build the AI's understanding of its subject, and be able to function like a smarter, more personalized version of the chatbots you can already interact with today.", "\"We chose this approach because we would like to help people solve the 'blank page syndrome' we have often seen when somebody tries to write in their diary,\" explains Eterni.me founder Marius Ursache. \"We want to encourage people to start curating their digital legacy and we will do that by triggering conversations based on previously collected data of what they did, felt, or experienced.\"", "Though Eterni.me's new app will be collecting all this information, the neural network backbone won't be able to turn that mass of unruly data into engaging conversations yet.", "\"The artificial intelligence that we need requires a lot of effort and time — it may take years,\" Ursache says. \"A lot of the people who expressed interest in Eterni.me don't have this time. This forces us to use more or less the the approach of the cryonics initiatives — preservation first, technology second.\"", "Meanwhile, a semblance of the company's vision has already come to \"life.\"", "Earlier this year, entrepreneur Eugenia Kudya created an AI-powered chatbot in honor of her friend Roman Mazurenko, who died tragically in 2015. Kudya and other mourners could \"speak\" with Roman by talking to the bot or asking it questions — its responses would be based on the thousands of texts messages and photos she had fed the neural network controlling its artificial intelligence.", "While the Roman bot couldn't narrate stories in the same way that Eterni.me envisions, it wrote in his voice. Talking to the bot helped Kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend.", "Inspired by the personal conversations that other people had with Roman's bot, she's now working on Replika, a new product that, like Eterni.me, will collect a person's stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them. The bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life. Your friends could talk to your Replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you.", "\"It's all about making people a little bit more open about themselves ... a little more vulnerable,\" Kudya says. \"Now even the first Replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it.\"", "The goal of the platform, she explains, isn't to let everyone create their own \"Roman\" that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of \"friend\" that is there every day to talk to, to make you \"more connected with your friends and yourself.\"", "But intention or not, a person's Replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that Eterni.me's avatars could.", "Over 100,000 people have reserved their Replika \"name\" and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version. Kudya was vague about when she thinks the technology will actually be good enough for the general public.", "The natural progression of Eterni.me or Replika's ideas would be to combine the AI with realistic digital 3D avatars (something Eterni.me eventually plans to do to, but has back-burnered while it works on the first part of its mission). Facebook is researching how to create life-like virtual reality avatars as are a host of different startups, including one called XXarray that explicitly envisions helping people create a digital legacy.", "Long-time VR researcher Jacki Morie coined the phrase \"the ultimate selfie\" to describe how she predicts that current technologies could eventually combine to create digital avatars that would not only would look like us, but move like us, and learn from us, too.", "She imagines that in the not-so-distant future, when using an avatar in VR is fairly common practice, people will be able to train a digital surrogate that could live on after they're gone.", "\"You'll be scanned and have this 3D construct that can then walk around in virtual worlds and it will retain the things that you did within an AI,\" she says. \"This kind of avatar could become a repository for our experiences and our memories.\"", "While the idea of talking to a dead relative through a digitized ghost may seem creepy — edging into bizarre \"uncanny valley\" territory — experts say that, on principle, it's actually a completely natural progression of the way that people have always grieved.", "Heather Servaty-Seib, a grief researcher and Purdue professor says that it's in line with the \"continuing bonds\" theory of bereavement. Death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one.", "Many already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard. (Or through a phone booth, like in Otsuchi, Japan where tsunami survivors \"call\" their lost loved ones.) Facebook allows people to \"memorialize\" the pages of the deceased and those pages often become a public and wide-reaching digital wake where friends and family share photos, memories, or their messages to the dead.", "AfterTalk prompts the bereaved to write letters to their loved ones that can either be private or shared with a therapist or family member. DeadSocial allows users to set up a curated Facebook-page of sorts where their love ones can commune once they've passed. They can even choose to schedule personal messages that will send from beyond the grave.", "If people have always found ways now to talk to the dead, could it be problematic if they start talking back?", "Both Servaty-Seib and grief therapist Dr. Bob Neymeyer agree that new ways to communicate with the dead could be healthy for many patients. Still, there are some potential pratfalls related to how we mourn. It could be damaging to children, who generally don't fully grasp the concept of death, Servaty-Seib says. Or it could be addictive to people already prone to focusing too much on the dead, deemphasizing other relationships and not moving forward, says Neymeyer. He's had patients who have listened to the dead's voicemail over and over or spent days on end at their grave.", "\"Now imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased,\" he says.", "Beyond the psychological implications, palliative care doctor Mark Taubert says that he doesn't think that it will be technically feasible for the tech to answer the kinds of burning questions people will have for their digitized loved ones.", "\"I often find that the questions a grieving friend or relative may have for the deceased are often quite difficult to answer, for example, 'Did you ever forgive me for what I did in ....?'\" he says. How could an artificially intelligent system taught simply to mimic your style and echo your memories tackle that difficult question in any real way?", "Digital legacy tools like Eterni.me or DeathLogic don't just serve the people left behind. They are very, very much about the person who is dying or thinking about their own eventual death.", "These services offer a way for us to build monuments to ourselves.

He sought to \"figure out what the government really does with the money,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"What really happens?\"", "On Tuesday, Mr. Ballmer plans to make public a database and a report that he and a small army of economists, professors and other professionals have been assembling as part of a stealth start-up over the last three years called USAFacts. The database is perhaps the first nonpartisan effort to create a fully integrated look at revenue and spending across federal, state and local governments.", "Want to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? Want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? Want to know what percentage of Americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? That’s in there. You can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways.", "Mr. Ballmer calls it \"the equivalent of a 10-K for government,\" referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make.", "\"You know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, Amazon or Apple, I’d get their 10-K and read it,\" he told me in a recent interview in New York. \"It’s wonky, it’s this, it’s that, but it’s the greatest depth you’re going to get, and it’s accurate.\"", "In an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, Mr. Ballmer’s project may serve as a powerful antidote. Using his website, USAFacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: How much revenue do airports take in and spend? What percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? At the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table.", "\"I would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"People can disagree about what to do — I’m not going to tell people what to do.\" But, he said, people ought to base their opinions \"on common data sets that are believable.\"", "So how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation’s data?", "Before he started, Mr. Ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this.", "His first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. \"My favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,\" he said. \"And by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there’s nothing I’m missing.\"", "But neither option led him to what he was looking for.", "\"You’ve got to look at federal, state and local together,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"Because I’m a citizen, I don’t care whether I give my money to A, B or C. I just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what’s going on.\"", "With an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and made a grant to the University of Pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. Altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants.", "\"Let’s say it costs three, four, five million a year,\" he said. \"I’m happy to fund the damn thing.\"", "For Mr. Ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data.", "\"I love this one!\" he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. \"Don’t look, don’t look!\" He instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page.", "\"How many people work for government in the United States?\" he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. \"Almost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?\"", "\"Then people say, ‘Those damn bureaucrats!’\" Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. \"Well, let’s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education — they are government employees.\" And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.", "\"And you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?\" Mr. Ballmer continued. \"Well, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn’t know that.\"", "Suddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we’re very glad to have.", "\"Now people might not think they’re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people — and most of these people you like,\" Mr. Ballmer said.", "His other big surprises?", "\"Most of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded,\" Mr. Ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. \"I mean it’s funny, but I didn’t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors.\"", "Mr. Ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. He has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. But as he speaks, you can tell that some of his findings from the new data — which rebut his preconceptions — could change his own politics.", "At one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, \"If you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they’re really subsidies to the affluent, which I guess I hadn’t thought about them.\"", "\"Take the mortgage deduction,\" he continued. \"This is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. That is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. I was a little surprised by that. You can have your own reaction; I was a little surprised by that.\"", "One rule Mr. Ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data — no outside providers — to avoid accusations of bias. But this created its own challenges.", "For example, Mr. Ballmer, said: \"You know it’s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? The government is not allowed to collect the number.\"", "There is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, \"along with other data, but not a total,\" he said. \"I can’t show it! I’m shocked! But the N.R.A. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can’t report the data.\"", "Mr. Ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. He hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports.", "\"We’re making philanthropic donations elsewhere — I think of this as another,\" he said, referring to himself and his wife. \"I don’t even deduct this for my taxes.

Maybe it's because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure. But in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the Earth's crust, found in Okla, Gabon. Uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions.", "The natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. The pile of rock in the ground in Okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago!", "It was discovered in 1972, when some French scientists took uranium ore from the mine in Gabon to test its uranium content. Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions.", "One would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium.", "That meant that, back at the mine, around 200 kilograms (around 440 pounds) of uranium 235 appeared to be missing. It hadn't been lost or stolen. Instead, this missing 0.003% had undergone nuclear fission and split into other atoms. This conclusion may very well have furrowed some brows since there are three very specific conditions that a reactor needs to churn out energy continuously. And as even scientists had struggled to create a nuclear reactor, it seemed unlikely that nature just happened to create one purely by accident.", "Unlikely, but not impossible, because that is exactly what happened.", "The conditions that the natural reactor happened to fulfill are as follows.", "The first was owning a good percentage of Uranium 235 to fuel the reaction. While 0.720% might seem small, it's perfect for nuclear fission, and when the ore samples from Okla are compared to other samples from all over the world, it is likely that this was the percentage over 2 billion years ago when the reactor started.", "The second condition is a source of neutrons. Uranium 235 decays naturally into thorium and releases a neutron in the process. This neutron can then whoosh towards another Uranium 235 atom and start the fission process. Nuclear fission is when an atom breaks apart into smaller atoms, usually releasing energy in the process. This neutron fuses with a Uranium 235, and together they combine to form Uranium 236, which is unstable. The Uranium 236 is then overwhelmed with instability and splits, creating a variety of smaller, stable atoms and some neutrons. These neutrons can then happily shoot towards other atoms and continue the chain reaction.", "The nuclear reactor had a supply of a regulating substance as well: a flow of natural groundwater. As the atoms started to split, they released neutrons as well as energy. The water would slow down the neutrons, but the energy would heat up the water. After a time, the water would get so hot that it would start to boil off. Eventually, enough of the water would have boiled away until there wasn't enough left in the reactor to slow down the neutrons.

The site spits out a seemingly never-ending bucket list of things we absolutely must do before we die: places to see, books to read, urinals to pee in. And as we all inch closer to our imminent deaths, BuzzFeed creates more and more of these articles, making it seemingly impossible to accomplish all of these things before we kick the can.", "If you're as young and bored as I am, though, you might wonder: Could you pull it off? Could you actually check everything off the BuzzFeed bucket list, and if so, how long would it take? A little while ago, I set out to find out for myself. Here's how I did it:", "First, I had to compile all of the lists BuzzFeed has published in its \"Before You Die\" format. At the time I filed this story, there were 182 lists. These ranged from appreciating the little things in life (like watching the sunset) to full-blown adventures (like going to South Africa's version of Burning Man). BuzzFeed writers also seem obsessed with food, since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing Aussie burgers or the ten best New Orleans po-boys or the 15 best cheese toasties in London.", "Next, I cataloged each task on each of the 182 lists. There are over a thousand individual tasks.", "On Motherboard: Counting the Hours I've Spent on the Internet", "Next, I calculated the time it would take to complete each of the tasks. This is where it all got slightly more complicated, since the time it would take to do most of these things is highly individualized. Eating fish and chips, for example—how long does that take the average person? If you were really vying for time, you could probably scarf some down in five minutes, but I'd much prefer to spend an hour savoring of a nice, greasy plate. And what if the restaurant was really busy and it took a long time for your server to bring the fish and chips to you? I settled on 30 minutes for eating fish and chips, as well as the other food-related tasks.", "Other tasks required a fair amount of research, like hiking the Camino de Santiago, otherwise known as St. James' path, between Spain and France, which is less like a path and more like a pilgrimage. The trail is nearly 500 miles long. According to the trail's official website, it takes four to six weeks to complete. I decided to allot 30 days to complete the trail, even though the website also noted that you would need to hike 18 miles per day without any rest days to finish the trail in that time, which seems completely insane.", "I repeated this process for every single task on Buzzfeed's lists. Again, there are over a thousand individual tasks.", "Here is a time table showing a small sample of the time I allotted for certain tasks:", "Some of the lists contained fast, easy tasks that be completed entirely from your couch—like this one, which requires you to look at 20 pictures of miniature pigs before you die—but for most of them, you have to travel. Some of the lists, like the Five Highest Places to Visit Before You Die, require you to jet-set from the Haiku Stairs of Oahu, Hawaii to the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to the Taihang Mountains in China. In order to accomplish all of the tasks most effectively, you would need to travel the world. So I decided to calculate the travel time that it would take to work your way around the world, in an order most efficient for accomplishing each of the BuzzFeed tasks.", "I decided to begin my hypothetical bucket-list journey in Boston, where I live, and work my way west through North America. I would visit 36 states in the United States and stop in Canada and Mexico along the way. Then onto the Dominican Republic to explore the three shipwrecks of Bayahibe, followed by stops at Turks and Caicos, and Belize. Some stops later, I'd spend 175 hours and ten minutes flying from country to country in Europe, stopping in Estonia to see the beech tree in Hiiumaa before taking a quick ten-minute flight over to Finland to go to the Kontula indoor skatepark in Helsinki. I'd make my way over to Turkey to swim in the crystal blue mineral waters of the Pamukkale Springs in Hierapolis and then pop over to Jordan to grab a drink at the Cave Bar in Petra.", "I whittled the travel time down to one-hour flights over borders, stopping in some countries for only a few minutes to visit a bakery or for a few hours to watch a sports game. In total, the round-the-world trip would take 26 days in travel time alone, and would include 108 countries.", "The last thing I calculated was sleep time. I figured a person would be fairly tired after spending months on end climbing mountains, reading plays, and visiting museums every day, so I allotted the doctor-recommended eight hours per night. I really enjoy sleeping, so this is painful for me to even imagine, but when you're racing to finish an extensive bucket-list in the fastest amount possible, I suppose luxuriating in the REM cycle shouldn't be a priority. I also factored in how long it took me to calculate the trip—around 40 hours in total—and how long it would take to actually book the flights, hotels, and day-trips, which would be possibly twice that.", "In conclusion—drumroll, please—I determined it would take 1,448.7 days to do everything that BuzzFeed says you need to do before you die. That's 207 weeks, or just shy of four years.", "I'll repeat that some of the timing calculations were arbitrary. You could get stuck in a restaurant with poor service and it might take double the time to eat your fish and chips, or you could arrive somewhere like the Trinity Church on King George Island in Antarctica and decide it was too boring to stay the full hour. Your flights could get delayed, or you could get food poisoning at one of the restaurants and choose to bail on the next day's activities. If you got the timing wrong, you might miss the small window when all 39 Christmas markets on the list are open, or arrive at the Mendenhall Ice Caves in Juneau, Alaska, to find that they have all melted.", "But if you planned it just right and you had the time, money, and stamina to accomplish everything on the list, then you could definitely do it.", "That said, I'm not sure why anyone would want to. There are a lot of things on that list that I, personally, have no interest in doing. Why should I visit 39 different Christmas markets across Europe? I mean, I'm sure they're beautiful and each have nice hot chocolate and giant, neon candy canes, but what's the harm in not seeing all 39 of them? Is it really worth the hours it would take to learn all 44 of these air guitar songs? Would I really be a lesser person for not having visited these 19 penis-shaped objects around the world?", "I'm not saying I wouldn't do it. If someone offered me the chance to travel the world and see some of the coolest things this Earth has to offer, I'd be hard pressed to say no. Of course, I'll probably die before that happens. BuzzFeed has a handy quiz for that, too."], "targetTitle": "We Calculated How Long It Would Take to Do Everything BuzzFeed Tells You to Do Before You Die", "targetDescription": "Could you pull it off?

But two nasty surprises have been discovered which may cause owners of the iPhone 7 to regret their purchase...", "‘Great Features’ and ‘Nasty Surprises’ are my regular columns investigating the latest software and hardware for the best features / biggest problems hidden behind the headlines.", "Nasty Surprise #1: Goodbye Sapphire?", "The first concern comes courtesy of popular YouTube channel JerryRigEverything. The famously diligent test site ran the iPhone 7 through the durability tests and claims Apple has ditched its premium sapphire glass from both the new home button and the camera lens:", "The revelation comes after JerryRigEverything used hardness picks to determine the makeup of both surfaces on the Mohs’ scale of mineral hardness. Previously his tests on the iPhone 6S confirmed the presence of sapphire, but this time both the new home button and larger camera of the iPhone 7 scratched easily using picks that do not damage sapphire.", "He concludes: \"we know for sure that it is regular glass and not sapphire.\"", "And here’s where it gets interesting, because Apple still advertises that both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as using sapphire (which is considerably more expensive than toughened glass) on the home button and camera lens. Given the new iPhones are marketed as more durable than ever this would be a major let down. I have put these claims to Apple and will update when/if the company responds.", "Note: As JerryRigEverything has not tested the iPhone 7 Plus we cannot make assumptions here. Being the more expensive model, it’s possible sapphire is still used there.", "Nasty Surprise #2: New Home Button, New Limitations", "The controversies around the new home button continue as well following a discovery by Myke Hurley, eagle eyed founder of RelayFM, who spotted the button only responds to capacitive touch not pressure.", "This means the button will not react should you be wearing standard gloves since there is no response anymore to physical movement. As he points out, if you want to test this for yourself then put some material (such as your shirt/t-shirt) over the button and try pressing.", "That’s right, you get nothing. Hardly ideal when winter and you need to wear gloves.", "There are a couple of ways around this. Firstly you can invest in ‘touchscreen gloves’ which use conductive thread to transfer the mild electrical charge in your skin to which capacitive touchscreens respond (note that’s a bogus claim that these don’t work, but I’ve tried two pairs and they do).", "Secondly you can setup AssistiveTouch, though that's primarily used for when an old physical home button is broken outside warranty. Feel free to insert your joke of choice here.", "Designed By Apple - For Apple?", "All of which leaves me in two minds about the iPhone 7’s biggest external changes and who they really help the most.", "For example, the new home button kills a weak spot in iPhone design for Apple as the old physical button was notorious for going wrong - it saves on warranty claims. But the taptic engine required to simulate physical movement uses all the space vacated by the headphone jack (as the photo from iFixit illustrates below).", "I’m not convinced many users would consider this the best way to utilise the additional space the headphone jack used. Personally a far bigger battery would’ve been top of my list.", "Then there are little cost cutting omissions. If sapphire has indeed been dropped from the iPhone 7 then that is a notable one (sapphire is 5-10x more expensive than toughened glass). Meanwhile there are little packaging shortcuts such as the removal of the earphone case. Instead earphones with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are just wrapped around a piece of card.", "This despite the fact iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus prices were increased compared to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus in every country.", "Yes there are good surprises in the new iPhones as well (most notably in the iPhone 7 Plus) but if you didn’t buy an iPhone 7 just yet, waiting a little longer for some answers is probably a good idea...", "___", "More On Forbes", "Apple iOS 10 Has 25 Great Secret Features", "Apple iOS 10.0.1: Should You Upgrade?", "Apple iPhone 7 Plus Has A Great Secret Feature", "iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus: What's The Difference?", "iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 6S: What's The Difference?"], "targetTitle": "Apple iPhone 7 Has Two Nasty Surprises", "targetDescription": "Apple's iPhone 7 has problems which may make customers regret upgrading...", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-18-at-01.51.18-1200x765.jpg?width=960", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/599933512/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000", "https://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-18-at-01.51.18-1200x765.jpg?width=640&height=434", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=400&d=mm&r=g", "http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-17-at-22.30.46.jpg?width=960", "http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-17-at-21.08.17-1200x658.jpg?width=960"], "targetUrl": "http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/09/17/apple-iphone-7-home-button-problems/#6edff832541d", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "No sapphire glass and capacitive home button", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["#1: Goodbye Sapphire?", "#2: New Home Button, New Limitations"], "spoilerPositions": [[[2, 15], [2, 36]], [[8, 15], [8, 51]]], "tags": ["multi"]}

So much so that he slept in a utility closet in college because it reduced his rent to only $100 a month.", "Tim and his wife Amanda recently attended the NFL’s Personal Finance Camp, which educates players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing.", "\"Personal finance acumen is important for everyone. It doesn’t matter if you’re a high income or a low income earner or somewhere in between. If you’re old or young or single or married. It’s important for everyone.\"", "You would think one of the professors leading the classes at the camp said this, but Tim did, after being asked why he attended. Spouses of players were invited to the event, which was held between April 4 and April 7 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.", "Meet the NFL player who lived in a utility closet in college to save money (1:31) Tim Masthay, of the Green Bay Packers, and his wife Amanda are the best team in the NFL when it comes to personal finance.", "When we asked the Masthays what they did with his first big NFL paycheck, they said a big chunk went toward the league’s 401(k) plan and another went into an education fund for their young children.", "And when asked if he ever had to switch financial advisers like many athletes do because they’re not happy with the advice or returns they’re getting, Tim said he’s never had one. He invests his money himself in low-cost index funds.", "And if you’re wondering how many credit cards they have. They have one.", "Also see: What it’s like to take a finance class with a lot of NFL players", "Tim, 29, met his wife Amanda while they were sophomores at the University of Kentucky. They married soon after graduating and have two children and a third on the way. They’re clearly a great team, but what made them so smart about money? Here’s what they shared with us.", "What it’s like to make so much money while you’re in your 20s", "Tim wasn’t drafted out of college but was signed — and released — by the Indianapolis Colts before the 2009 season started. He later signed with the Green Bay Packers and has had great success with them. He signed a five-year, $6 million contract in 2012 that included a $1.2 million signing bonus. And he won a Super Bowl with the Packers in 2011.", "I almost fell on the floor when I saw his first paycheck. Amanda Masthay", "While Tim was trying to make an NFL roster, Amanda was working as a bank teller making $9 an hour. \"That was all the money we had. So we went from getting by to the first paycheck that he got. I almost fell on the floor when I saw it. I had never seen that much money in my life,\" Amanda said.", "They were tempted to buy things when they got the check. \"It took a lot of restraint and we sort of had to wrap our heads around it so that we didn’t buy some car that we really couldn’t afford,\" she said.", "Tim says that first paycheck was for $9,000, and that while it was a lot of money to him, too, it was at the league minimum. \"There was this influx of money at a young age where we were accustomed to being on scholarship, but it wasn’t quite as traumatic as what some players who are top draft picks experience.\"", "The unique financial challenges of being an NFL player — and the wife of a player", "When you start making a lot of money in the league, you have to figure out what to do with it, Tim said. \"How do I spend it? How do I save it? How do I budget? How am I going to play? Because it’s very difficult to project how much you’re going to earn in an NFL career. It might be a one-year career, and it might be a five-year career.\"", "How the NFL keeps its players from going broke (1:58) See what it's like to attend the NFL's Personal Finance Camp, which trains players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing.", "He said another challenge is that they’re only paid during the season, except for a small off-season stipend. \"We receive eight or nine paychecks throughout the year and you’ve got to do all of your budgeting and saving based off of those checks. It’s a little different way of being paid than I think most people are,\" Tim said.", "But he also acknowledged that \"if you have some vision for the future, it’s a fantastic opportunity in terms of investment.\"", "How they got so smart about money", "The Masthays said their educations at the University at Kentucky — he was an economics major and she was a marketing major — were helpful, and that lessons they learned at a young age were also influential.", "\"If we ever went on vacation as kids, I remember being 6 or 7 and my mom would give me a check register and I would do chores around the house and go wash people’s cars and save up for my spending money,\" Amanda said.", "Tim said that at Kentucky’s business school he took a class in his sophomore year — in which he met Amanda, incidentally — and the professor said if you can save $10,000 when you’re 20 years old and if the stock market were to return what it’s historically returned, you’d have $1 million when you were 60. \"I remember thinking, wow that’s interesting,\" he said.", "That made him think of ways he could save some of his scholarship money, which was $750 a month. One way he did that was to live in a utility closet for $100 a month in a house that four of his friends lived in. He said it was just big enough to fit a bed.", "\"By the time I graduated I had saved $10,000 while living on a scholarship check. That’s what I bought her wedding ring with,\" he said. (He spent part of it on the ring.)", "Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images Tim Masthay punting in a game against the Buffalo Bills on Dec. 14, 2014.", "One mistake?", "Tim said one area they could have been smarter in is real estate. They bought a house in Kentucky for the off-season while also owning a home in Green Bay. They’ve since sold the Kentucky home but say they didn’t like owning a home they only used for part of the year.", "Marriage and money", "Amanda said one of the reasons she was interested in attending the Personal Finance Camp was to see what they could do to minimize financial stress during the season.", "\"Finance is one of the biggest elements of stress for most people, so if there’s something we can do that’s going to make something else a little bit easier, then why wouldn’t we want to learn about that and try to implement it in our lives?\"", "During the interview, Amanda and Tim were in agreement on most things and at times finished each other’s sentences.

I played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games. Freshman and sophomore years, I made it onto the junior varsity team — a miracle.", "By 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse. This is when my history teacher — the varsity coach — pulled me aside and suggested I shouldn't bother. I'd probably be cut, he said (adding that I was getting very good grades).", "For me, practice did not make perfect. Lo and behold, I now have scientific validation.", "A meta-analysis in Perspectives in Psychological Science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn't matter that much.", "More precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other.", "Even more simply: Some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone. There was a reason I lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field. They probably had a natural advantage on me.", "\"One important thing — that's easy to misunderstand— is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual,\" Brooke Macnamara, the lead author of the Perspectives paper, tells me. \"So if a person practices, they will get better. Almost across the board, practice should improve one’s performance.\"", "But it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. \"Essentially, learning rates vary,\" Macnamara says. \"Some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice.\"", "The analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played.

And often, it’s a calling because you find a deep sense of purpose and positive impact in your role. And fortunately, the data show that purpose is incredibly tied to both business and personal success. In Corporate Culture and Performance, authors John Kotter and James Heskett write that purposeful, value-based companies outperform their counterparts with 400% higher revenues, 700% greater job growth and 1,200% higher stock prices. But having purpose doesn’t only impact the organization you work for; it also impacts you. Research from the Hay Group shows that highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations than their least engaged counterparts. As a result, I believe that, to be both successful and fulfilled, it is crucial to understand what purpose means to you.", "Granted, finding your purpose is a proactive pursuit. Many people start to explore their feelings when they’re unhappy, dissatisfied with their job and/or upset with their personal life. But it is important to find time to reflect when you find yourself in a good place, too. When you’re experiencing fulfillment and joy in your work or in your personal life, take a moment to ask yourself, \"What am I doing right now that is making me fulfilled?\" Are you helping someone? Are you coding? Are you being creative? Are you creating the best financial model the world has ever seen? The answers to this question often bring to the surface what is important to you and can help you recreate that satisfaction moving forward.", "I’ve also found it helpful to create a personal vision for your life. Spend some time thinking about what your ideal day would be like. I keep a \"dream book\" myself, and I’ve filled it with things that are important to me—from building a great tech company that is tackling a hard but important problem to building and maintaining lifelong friendships to checking items off of my travel bucket list. It even includes a picture of a well-landscaped backyard because that’s been on my list of projects to tackle—and trust me, you need vision to see beyond the weeds that are back there today.", "So spend time creating a vision for your life.

As John Adams himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797, the transfer of power was \"the sublimest Thing ever exhibited in America.\"", "But while Adams was the first to experience that transition, it wasn't until four years later that the principle was put to the test.", "After all, George Washington didn't want to run again for the 1796 election and Adams kept power within the same party. In 1800, on the other hand , the United States saw its first hotly contested election and its first transfer of power between political parties. The result was close, and it also left Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied, with the House spending a week deciding who would be President. (At the time, the Vice President was whoever came in second.) It was easily conceivable that the entire system would fall apart, but instead Jefferson became President and his rivals—the incumbent Adams as well as Burr—accepted the result. As Jefferson would later write , the \"revolution of 1800\" was a big deal:", "[It was] as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people. The nation declared its will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election.", "This principle—that the nation declares its will by voting, and the functionaries of government peacefully accept the choice—has even been upheld when perhaps the candidate might have wished to do otherwise.", "For example, some believe that the 1960 presidential election was subject to substantial enough voting irregularities that Richard Nixon should have won. (In fact, there is no concrete evidence either way .) But, even though it was an extremely close race and some of his supporters urged him to fight the result, Nixon decided that, in keeping with tradition, it was better to accept the fact that early returns indicated John F Kennedy had won. In a late-night speech to supporters, he explained why:", "As all of you in this room know, and as all of you millions who are listening on television and radio realize, it is normally the custom for a candidate for the Presidency...not to appear until after the decision is definitely known, and all the votes are counted beyond doubt. However, I have been keeping some pretty late hours recently as some of you have...I know too that many who are listening in the Eastern part of the United States will find that it is now about 3:15 in the morning... I want to say that one of the great features of America is that we have political contests, that they are very hard fought, as this one was hard fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected... I want Senator Kennedy to know, and I want all of you to know, that certainly if this trend continues, and if he does become our next President, he will have my whole-hearted support.", "That tradition even held true in 2000. As TIME's David Von Drehle has pointed out , that year's concession from Al Gore to George W. Bush was a long time in coming not because Gore refused to accept the results of the vote, but because there was no result to accept yet. In fact, when it became clear what the result would be, Gore followed the precedent of hundreds of years' worth of elections, as he peacefully accepted the outcome of the vote. As he explained in his concession speech, that was what patriotism required:", "Almost a century and a half ago, Senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, ''Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr. President, and God bless you.'' Well, in that same spirit, I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy.", "That doesn't mean the tradition has always been honored by everyone. In 1860, after Abraham Lincoln was elected, Stephen Douglas (the runner-up for the popular vote) had cause to utter those words later quoted by Gore, as he conceded the result. But, even before the election took place, the South had already warned the nation that a victory by Lincoln and the Republican Party would be unacceptable in their eyes.", "South Carolina seceded from the Union that December, declaring that the North was \"united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.\" Rather than accept the electoral result, the state convention announced that \"public opinion at the North has invested a great political error\" and that South Carolina would not go along with the outcome. The rest of the Confederacy would soon follow South Carolina's lead.

Here’s Why"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["A Democratic presidential candidate has not won a majority of votes in Nebraska for more than 50 years. But on Thursday, Hillary Clinton’s campaign announced it would begin spending precious advertising dollars in the state. The advertising buy is focused on Nebraska’s second congressional district, and includes two ads about Clinton’s advocacy for children.", "It is an expensive bet on a state that has almost always voted red. But there’s a simple reason behind what seems like a gamble: Nebraska allocates its electoral college votes not in the usual winner-take-all method, but by congressional district. So a Republican candidate can win in the state, but a Democratic candidate can still pick up electoral votes by winning over a district.", "The second congressional district, which is centered in Omaha and its suburbs, has a history of occasionally voting differently from the rest of deep-red Nebraska.", "The district went for Mitt Romney in 2012 but for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. In 2014, when Democrats lost a wave of congressional races across the country, Democrat Brad Ashford won the district’s seat in U.S. Congress. And as a Clinton aide pointed out, the African-American share of the vote in the district is higher than the statewide average—and Clinton has shown she consistently over-performs among black voters.", "The electoral college’s winner-take-all system means that reliably Democratic states like Massachusetts and Oregon—or reliably Republican states like Texas and Alabama—are never seriously contested by presidential candidates. They predictably vote Democratic or Republican. But in Nebraska and Maine—the two states that allocate their electoral votes by congressional district—there is more room for the parties to maneuver. They can spend ad dollars and campaign in states that they could never win outright.", "It’s an electoral strategy that Donald Trump is hoping to take advantage of, too. This week he campaigned in Maine, which also allocates its electoral votes by congressional district but usually supports a Democrat. He held a rally in Bangor in the state’s second congressional district, which is predominantly white and rural.", "Clinton has begun a broad and expensive advertising campaign in the swing states that you’d expect: Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, Nevda, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina. In those states, as well as in her Nebraska ad buy, Clinton has aired advertisements that tout her role in the creation of the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the 1990s.", "These are the two ads that will be playing in Nebraska."], "targetTitle": "Hillary Clinton Is Advertising in Deep-Red Nebraska.

Rowling‘s Harry Potter saga, and watching the films, we know a lot about one of our favorite professors and Head of Gryffindor house, Professor Minerva McGonagall. Stern but fair, McGonagall expected a lot from her students, but she also cared for them deeply, even if she didn’t always outwardly express it. However, what if there was something about Professor McGonagall that we never thought about before? Reddit user Obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad-ass witches in the entire HP saga.", "Obversa suggests that \"Professor McGonagall was originally hired by Dumbledore to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA) in 1956. However, not long after, Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) came back to Hogwarts, seeking the DADA position for himself. Dumbledore denied Voldemort’s application and as a result, Voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any DADA professor from ‘lasting more than a year’. Dumbledore then transferred McGonagall to the Transfiguration position before the term’s end, to prevent anything \"bad\" or \"dangerous\" from happening to her. After all, as long as she wasn’t teaching DADA , the jinx technically wouldn’t apply to her.\" Obversa says, \"Prior to being Headmaster, Dumbledore served as Transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching Tom Riddle himself as a child. He was also McGonagall’s predecessor, under Headmaster Armando Dippet. Thus, when Dumbledore succeeded Dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of Transfiguration.\" We know that Minerva McGonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there?", "As a result of Pottermore, we know a bit more about Professor McGonagall’s backstory (which is extremely similar to Lord Voldermort’s background). McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore’s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement. But why would Dumbledore hire a brilliant McGonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at Hogwarts? If you recall, one of the reasons why Headmaster Dippet rejected Tom Riddle’s application for the DADA teaching position, at age 17-18 for Tom, was because Tom was \"too young\". However, Dippet encouraged Tom \"to come back a few to several years later to apply again\". At the time, McGonagall was still perhaps too young, to be a Hogwarts professor in her own right.", "Additionally, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix McGonagall told Dolores Umbridge that she had been teaching at Hogwarts for \"Thirty-nine years this December\". Order of the Phoenix takes place in 1995 and 1996, with this statement coming in approximately September 1995. Therefore, McGonagall’s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year, very odd timing. But, why would McGonagall who is obviously gifted in Transfiguration initially apply to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor?", "Take note of Professor McGonagall’s wand. It’s made of Fir with a core of Dragon Heartstring. The Wandmaker Ollivander once called it the, ‘the survivor’s wand,’ because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed. This means that if the wand chooses the wizard, McGonagall would have been destined for a lot more than Transfiguration.", "It seems likely then that McGonagall started teaching as Dumbledore’s assistant in December of 1956, and, at some point, applied for (and received) the DADA job. However, Lord Voldemort arrived to Hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself. Once Dumbledore refused, Voldy put a hex on the position, so McGonagall had to be transferred to Transfiguration. After all, the Dark Lord was probably, \"angry, vindictive, and jealous of McGonagall, and wanted to take his revenge for what he saw as \"what was rightfully his\". He was also obsessed with the similarities between the amazingly gifted witch. Just as he was continually obsessed with the similarities between Harry Potter and himself throughout the entire saga."], "targetTitle": "You Won’t Believe This Stunning ‘Harry Potter’ Revelation About Professor McGonagall", "targetDescription": "This stunning revelation about Professor McGonagall changes everything we thought we knew about the Harry Potter saga!", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://www.media4.hw-static.com/media/2016/05/maggie-smith-harry-potter-warner-bros-052516-638x425.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-ef1y0A8erBLUc.gif", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3002265&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "targetUrl": "http://www.hollywood.com/movies/you-wont-believe-this-stunning-harry-potter-revelation-about-professor-mcgonagall-60584784/", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "She was hired to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, but after Tom Riddle cursed the position, Dumbledore moved her to Transfiguration to protect her.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore’s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement."], "spoilerPositions": [[[2, 147], [2, 230]]], "tags": ["passage"]}

{"uuid": "5ed79752-7735-4f6e-b1ab-1b57c10ca144", "postId": "4w5lgv", "postText": ["Is It Ethical to Kill Poachers?"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["Protecting the world’s endangered species from poachers is dangerous business.", "Over the past decade, more than 1,000 rangers have died in the line of duty, according to statistics released last week for World Ranger Day. Some deaths were caused by accidents or animals. Most, however, were murders committed by heavily armed poachers who enter national parks and other protected areas in search of species such as tigers, rhinos, and elephants.", "At the same time, rangers have killed hundreds of poachers, often spurred by the shoot on sight policies that have become the norm in several parks. The numbers add up: Between 2011 and 2015, rangers at South Africa’s Kruger National Park alone reportedly killed nearly 500 poachers.", "While these rangers are undoubtedly heroes who all too often lay down their lives to protect the animals in their care, some organizations have begun to raise questions about the retaliatory bloodshed, asking if it is ethical or moral for rangers to kill suspected poachers without arrest or trial. The issue came to bear most recently last month after a guard in India’s Kaziranga National Park, which has a shoot-to-kill policy, critically wounded a seven-year-old boy from a tribe that lives around the park.", "\"We’re pretty horrified by the situation,\" said Sophie Grig, senior campaigner at Survival International, a tribal rights organization that has criticized the recent Kaziranga shooting and shoot-to-kill policies in general. \"It seems to us a very worrying trend that is bad for both local people who get caught in the crossfire and for conservation.\"", "Grig also wonders if shooting poachers even solves the larger problem. \"If you were arresting those people and then investigating them, you could trace back and work out who the kingpins are,\" she said. \"If you shoot them dead, you can’t ask them any questions.\"", "Annette Hübschle, who recently authored a report on rhino poaching for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, echoed those sentiments. She said the \"current militarized approach\" is pushing people away from any chance they might have to participate in conservation. \"There should be a greater focus on investigating the transporters and buyers, prosecuting organized criminals such as kingpins and smugglers, ‘follow the money’ approaches, and seizing assets of criminals,\" she said.", "Aside from legal strategies, the issue of whether or not poachers should be killed brings up several potential lines of ethical thought, said Anna Peterson, a professor in the department of religion at the University of Florida and the author of Being Animal: Beasts and Boundaries in Nature Ethics.", "One way of thinking about it, she said, is to ask if individual sentient beings have value and if there is a difference in that value between a human life and that of a rhinoceros. She pointed to ethicist Tom Regan’s test, which asked if you would throw a dog out of a lifeboat to save yourself. \"Essentially, Regan said you would always throw out the dog on the basis of complexity and what would be lost by a human’s death rather than a dog’s death,\" she said.", "More broadly, Peterson said, you could ask if a species is rare and significant and if its ecosystem would suffer in its absence.

The town name is extremely popular in this country and the family’s creator, Matt Groening, has never quite revealed its true location.", "Groening has actually said in the past that the Springfield in the show was named after Springfield, Oregon, but didn’t go so far as to admit \"street names and locations\" were, as well.", "In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece \"Matt Groening Reveals the Location of the Real Springfield.\" Here’s part of the piece that gets into the Oregon connection:", "OK, why do the Simpsons live in a town called Springfield? Isn’t that a little generic? Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon. The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show \"Father Knows Best\" took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown. When I grew up, I realized it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, \"This will be cool; everyone will think it’s their Springfield.\" And they do. You’ve never said it was named after Springfield, Oregon, before, have you? I don’t want to ruin it for people, you know? Whenever people say it’s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, \"Yup, that’s right.\"", "This article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both Groening and Jean as they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery. The show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where Bart Simpson repeatedly wrote, \"The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours.\"", "Jean told Jean told TV Guide at the time that Smithsonian Magazine \"misinterpreted something [he has] heard [Groening] say for at least 10 or 20 years.\" Jean continued, \"He was inspired by growing up in Portland, but it’s really an every town. It’s really funny. Matt grew up in Oregon and parts of ‘The Simpsons’ were definitely inspired by his childhood. But there is no specific state that Springfield is in, and we will never reveal that secret.\"", "Further trying to dispel that Groening revealed the location, Jean reminded TV Guide readers that \"The Simpsons Movie\" hinted that the town’s true whereabouts are geographically impossible.", "\"In the movie we say [Springfield] borders on Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky,\" said Jean. \"So good luck finding that state. When you do, you’re a true ‘Simpsons’ fan.\"", "For what it’s worth, Ohio has a city named Oregon. The state of Oregon does border Nevada. The city of Portland, Oregon, was named after the city of Portland, Maine. And there is an unincorporated community that calls itself \"Oregon\" in Kentucky.", "In a way (however tenuous), all of those named states from the movie have geographical connections to Oregon. \"The Simpsons\" Springfield = Springfield, Oregon. The homepage of the official website for the Oregonian city even claims, \"Yes, this is the ‘real’ Springfield from ‘The Simpsons.’\"", "Of course, even if this is true, Jean and Groening will likely never fully admit it. Jean continued his answer about Springfield, Oregon, during the press conference by saying, \"But the great thing about [the show’s city] is it’s universal.

We were talking about how excited we were to attend an upcoming wedding in Kalamazoo (where we met and went to college) and discussing what would be the perfect gift for the newlyweds. So, I thought back to our wedding day (nearly 9 years ago) and tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me. The funny thing? The gift that meant the very most was still sitting in a closet... ... unopened. On our wedding day, my husband Brandon and I received a gift from my Great Aunt Alison. On the plain white box was a card that read, \"Do not open until your 1st disagreement.\" Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years. There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up... but we never opened the box. I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure. To us, it would have meant that we didn’t have what it takes to make our marriage work – and we’re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations. Was it really time to open the box? What if this isn’t our worst fight? What if there’s a worse one ahead of us and we don’t have our box?!? As my Great Uncle Bill would say, 'Nothing is ever so bad that it couldn’t get worse.' All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage – an age old trick – unbeknownst to us rookies. After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save \"us\" – and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all. For 9 years (and three moves) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust, yet it somehow taught us about tolerance, understanding, compromise and patience. Our marriage strengthened as we became best friends, partners, and teammates. Today, we decided to open that box, because I finally had a realization.

Now that our story has gotten so much attention and has inspired others, it seems to be the gift that keeps on giving!\"As for her wise great aunt, Kathy says, \"She is just tickled by how much attention this has gotten – how many people have shared that they wish they had an 'Aunt Alison' and those that think her gift was absolutely genius. She didn't realize just how special the gift was to us until a number of years after our wedding when she found out that we hadn’t opened it yet.\"Aunt Alison was surprised that we kept it for nine years, then the lessons it taught us – inadvertently – and now she’s even more surprised at the response our story has received.\"And when it comes to their best advice to other couples when it comes to handling disagreements, she says, \"For the little things, learn how to disagree and move on. For the bigger things, learn how to get mad and get over it. Giving up was never an option in our situation because we never had the illusion that marriage was going to be easy.

As living things, humans are still evolving. Since we became Homo sapiens, has evolution changed us in any way? Actually, yes.", "Thousands of genes have evolved recently (in the last 40,000 years). Changes we are seeing include smaller brains (more efficient, not dumber), resistance to diseases, increases in ADHD and blue eyes. Yes, blue eyes. Genetic analysis says the first blue-eyed human appeared 6,000-10,000 years ago somewhere in the Black Sea region. For whatever reason, the phenotype became very popular (conferring a 5% greater chance for reproduction) and today about half a billion blue-eyed folk exist.", "Another famous example is HgbS (sickling hemoglobin), a gene that makes humans immune to malaria. Malaria is the number one killer of humans, so it makes sense that a mutation eventually arose that makes human red blood cells resistant to the malaria parasites, and for the gene to rise in frequency in malaria-prone populations (sub-Saharan Africa). Unfortunately, the same gene also causes sickle cell anemia. We all have two copies of every gene in our body (one from mom, one from dad), and if one copy is the malaria-resistant mutant HgbS, you're fine, but if both are the mutant, you get sickle cell disease. The good news is that many other genes confer resistance to malaria, and we are also seeing leprosy and tuberculosis resistance genes appearing, too.", "Another example is the gene for lactose tolerance. Primitive man would drink milk as a baby, and then never again, so the amount of lactase enzyme (which breaks down a common sugar in milk) would fall after a few years of age. Over time, however, humans have evolved so that certain populations will keep producing the enzyme into late adulthood. As expected, the lactose-tolerant trait appears most often in the regions where dairy farming arose first and became an important part of the diet (Caucasians). Tolerance for milk is supposed to have evolved only 3,000-8,000 years ago, and is now found in nearly 95% of North Europeans.", "Our mouths are changing, too. They are getting smaller and more bullet-shaped. Our teeth aren't quite changing as fast, which is why orthodontics and wisdom teeth removal still exist ... for now. More and more people are being born without wisdom teeth, or have their wisdom teeth erupt later if at all. Wisdom teeth were useful before knives and cooking, when humans would probably lose molars to chewing hard food and needed the wisdom teeth as replacements. Today, 35% of people lack wisdom teeth, although the genes involved in this are unknown so we aren't quite sure why this is happening yet.", "Darwin's theory of natural selection evolves.", "So what will we look like 100,000 years from now, assuming we still exist that far in the future? Even if we ignore new technologies, moving off the earth, and various selection pressures, evolution still holds surprises just by chance mutation. Ten thousand years ago nobody had blue eyes.

In other words, Clinton’s employment of North Orange Street amounts to a telling,.

The release date brought a fighter with many characters, lots of gameplay modes and frantic item-throwing fun. But nothing's perfect -- in the case of Smash Bros 4, the mulitplayer lag is a huge issue. Whether it be local multiplayer in Sm4sh or online, the game stutters early and often.", "The game is superb -- which is why it pains us that no matter what stage we choose, our Smash Bros 4 fights always take place in Lag City. We got a hint of this when we did our review for SSB43DS but chalked it up to all other players being located halfway across the world in Japan. Now that the game's out in our country, we thought our lag issues would be alleviated. Boy were we wrong.", "Now, don't get us wrong -- we agree with Louis CK . The fact that we can play a video game with anyone around the world is amazing. But Smash is serious business. Despite being a fighting game, the lag is pretty consistent. So, we quantified it.", "(Smash bros)", "Super Smash Bros 4 Lag: Online Multiplayer", "We began our testing using both the For Fun and For Glory modes on the 3DS. Similar to when I played Sm4sh for the review, we experienced constant lag throughout gameplay. During our For Fun plays, button presses were consistently between .30 to .40 milliseconds late. Not a huge amount obviously, though certainly noticeable.", "During our 3rd match during For Fun while playing online using our home wifi network, Smash Bros 4 decided to leave us indefinitely in the training mode (just before the match begins). We're not sure if this was a network problem, someone dropped off, or just a glitch in the game. Without the ability to hit the Home Button we were forced to turn it off. On to For Glory then.", "(Smash Bros)", "For Glory saw lag go as high as .63 milliseconds after buttons were pressed. Though similar to For Fun, the lag was consistent. If you're fine with pressing buttons twice just to make sure they register, you can complete a match relatively trouble free.", "(Smash Bros)", "SSB4: Local Multiplayer", "Playing Smash with our Bros in person was a different story. For some reason having everyone in the same room made our multiplayer lag experience worse than the online equivalent. I and two others with the game sitting in a circle (err, triangle) not more than 5 feet from each other ran into considerable lag when playing Super Smash Bros 4.", "We played the game for nearly 3 hours using various characters and stages. In a set of about 15 stages, the first few went off without a hitch -- with the occasional hiccup. The same couldn't be said for the second half of our marathon Smash session.", "5 of the latter 7 matches lagged uncontrollably to the point where the loading spinner appeared on screen telling us to wait. Having one player completely lose all their stock lives with only 2 fighters remaining on screen didn't help the situation. Despite having never moved physically, the rate of waiting for the throbber varied -- at times reaching 3-4 seconds.", "In a 2nd round of local Smash Bros 4 multiplayer \"testing\" (read: playing in the office, for science!) 2 players was much easier on the system. The most lag we encountered occurred when 2 human players and a 3rd CPU player was thrown in the mix. Surprisingly, 2 human players and 2 CPUs resulted in no lag.", "(Smash Bros)", "SSB4 Online Lag Fixes And Placebos", "Having this much lag in a multiplayer game, especially one like Super Smash Bros 4, detracts from the overall experience. Though at least online the lag was consistent enough to get used to. The sporadic nature of local multiplayer's random loading dials and epic slow downs make more than 2 (human) player battles pretty annoying.", "So guys, found out I had lag because of my #3ds aluminum case. #smashbros pic.twitter.com/wd5lW2PQnS — Raymond Lancione (@raylancione) October 7, 2014", "If anyone's having #SmashBros lag online, apparently it gets better if you plug in the charger while playing. — It was me, Milu! (@miluette) October 6, 2014", "\"Connectivity can depend heavily on location so I really don’t know what to say. At the very least, we’ve confirmed that smooth play is possible under various conditions of external networks. During multi-player, you’re connected with another player and sending light amounts of data back and forth, so if the game feels laggy, it’s due to the connection speed. If you play when it’s laggy, then the person you’re playing with will experience the same lag, so it’s best to play when the connection is clear.", "During development, there were cases where we had too many people and the connection became sluggish, so we turned off our cell phones and the connection would clear up. It’s best to avoid playing while streaming something or by a tethered connection. Free wi-fi spots are probably not very good either.\"", "(Wordpress)", "The Part Where I Complain About The 3DS Hardware", "Something tells me the new 3DS was made because the current one can't handle Super Smash Bros. This is the first time a Smash game has been made available for handheld and already we've seen reports of broken circle pads and awkward control schemes . The 3DS charger improving the online performance likely hints at the processing power of Nintendo's hardware -- likely holding back in an effort to save battery life. Not to mention OG 3DS owners not getting access to the beloved C-stick.", "Nintendo's hardware always lags behind the competition but they've been able to get around it by bringing us great games. But what happens when even your own killer first party title doesn't run properly on yesterday's hardware you swore by? Would the PS Vita have these lag issues? Could the Ice Climbers have part of Smash Bros for the iPhone ? (Not that you could ever seriously play Smash on a smartphone, but not the point).", "Though all in all, Smash players now that the 3DS version isn't the real experience. Having the game with us at all times is nice, but the real showdowns will take place on the Wii U -- in HD and with GameCube controllers in hand.

But as Trump's win proved true in politics, the cannabis industry, too, is riddled with white men in power—even if they aren't the ones who deserve all the credit. Women—from researchers studying the benefits of cannabis over opiates, to award-winning chefs cooking up the most delicious edibles on the planet, to those who are facing massive jail time for activism and legalization efforts—are the true heroes of the cannabis industry, and it’s time to recognize that. To celebrate women in weed, we spoke to 15 of the most powerful and influential women in the business:", "1. Dr. Lakisha Jenkins, Master Herbalist", "Dr. Lakisha Jenkins has a doctorate in naturopathy, is a member of the American Herbalist Guild, and is a master herbalist, and founding board member of the California Cannabis Industry Association. Beyond helping write the legalization laws that just passed in the state of California, Dr. Jenkins can take 500 varieties of herbs and marry them with cannabis to treat whatever ails you. If you love pot and natural medicine, she’s someone you want to know.", "Unfortunately, despite the abundance of healing Dr. Jenkins gives back to the world, she went through great loss to get where she is today. \"My oldest daughter Kiona was diagnosed with two different types of brain tumors in 2002 when she was eight years old, and I questioned whether chemotherapy and radiation was the right course of action for treatment for her,\" explains Dr. Jenkins. \"I was informed that the State of California knows what’s better for my daughter than I do and that if I did anything different than conventional treatment, then I’d be acting outside of medical advice and that I would be a threat to her. Unfortunately, I was forced to accept, but while she was going through chemotherapy and radiation, I started researching and studying for my doctorate, and figuring out other holistic alternatives.\"", "Kiona passed away in January 2006, 12 days shy of her twelfth birthday. Dr. Jenkins now practices in her honor, going back to her roots and using ancestral healing techniques.", "\"My family is from the Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians, so we have Native American lineage and my grandfather is a native healer,\" she explains. \"I just went back to my native roots and just researched.\" Along with her work as a healer, Dr. Jenkins strives to create room for minorities in the cannabis industry that is too often dominated by white men due to financial advantages and their inherent privilege.", "\"There’s a privilege that is associated with being a white male in this country, you don’t have that same type of fear that other minority groups or other people do and you’re more in a position to take a risk in jumping into this industry,\" explains Dr. Jenkins, who has also been a part of the Minority Business Council for three years.", "Her advice to women and other minorities looking to break through? \"Be fearless and strong in your conviction. Know what you stand for and know what you are trying to accomplish and don’t let anything get in your way. Surround yourself with other like-minded people who can be your support system and your tribe and then educate yourself, because education is going to be what’s going to help you persevere. Because people are going to challenge you all the time. But if you can come back with those challenges with hard evidence and experience, and really speak to the level of professionalism that this industry is going to command, you’ll be taken seriously.\"", "2. Rachel K. Gillette, Attorney", "An unfortunate aspect of the cannabis industry is that due to lingering federal laws and constantly evolving local ones, if you work with weed, you'll likely need a lawyer at some point. That’s where Rachel Gillette comes in", "an attorney who has been working with the regulated cannabis industry since 2010. Her areas of practice include corporate licensing compliance, tax law for marijuana businesses, and pretty much anything related to the operations of cannabis businesses regulated by the state of Colorado.", "\"I’ve always been an advocate for the legalization of marijuana,\" says Gillette. \"So in 2010, when I saw the state of Colorado was going to be regulating, being the first state in the nation to do so, I decided to quit my job and to start my own practice which focused on the representation of these newly-formed business enterprises.\" At the time, Gillette was taking a major risk since few larger firms were ready to take on cannabis clients. However, Gillette’s instincts and boldness paid off and she staked her claim in what is now a booming industry.", "Gillette says her favorite part the job is that marijuana law is constantly evolving \"We’re doing something that has never been done before, so there’s a lot of opportunities to blaze the trail, so to speak, no pun intended,\" she explains. Not to mention, working to help victims of America’s War On Drugs: \"We’ve had 40 years of a failed drug war, our fathers, our brothers, our children are incarcerated at alarming rates unfortunately for minority populations, and disproportional rates for minority populations, and as women, we shouldn’t stand for that anymore.\"", "3. Lynne Lyman, California State Director for the Drug Policy Alliance", "While California cannabis users celebrate their state’s recent marijuana legalization accomplishment, (nice Hollyweed sign), Lynne Lyman’s work is just getting started. She's the California state director of the non-profit organization Drug Policy Alliance, \"the leading organization advancing drug policies grounded in science, compassion, health, and human rights.\"", "\"We always say November 8th wasn’t the end, it was the beginning,\" she explains. \"That’s true with most laws", "often policymakers forget to think about the implementation piece and sometimes that’s the most important piece, because if you pass a law and it doesn’t get implemented, then it’s as if it didn’t pass.\"", "Along with working to fund cannabis research, Lyman’s biggest passion is making marijuana and marijuana-advocacy communities more inclusive, especially by creating space for those were were a vital part of the weed industry before it was sanctioned by mainstream society.", "\"You’re walking in today to this whole nice legal world where everybody can wear a name tag that says they’re with some cannabis association, whereas five years ago even, people were still doing federal time for having a dispensary,\" Lyman explains. \"The advice I give to all of the people who come into the cannabis industry is understand the history. There’s the sense that people are just waltzing in as if it’s just any other industry. I want to discourage that and remind that a lot of people have died, people have been incarcerated, they’ve had their families destroyed. Making sure you’re a good neighbor, and you’re working with the community that you are based in.\"", "Lyman says that while we see often see white men as the faces of legal weed businesses, that doesn't mean they're the ones who laid the groundwork for legalization in the first place. \"One thing that has been true historically in the cannabis movement is that it’s been men’s faces at the forefront and yet it’s been a lot of women doing the behind-the-scenes work,\" explains Lyman. \"I’m in room after room saying it cannot be all white men in the industry. You have to find a way to expand and let other people in. That’s a policy priority for DPA.\"", "4. Charlo Greene, Founder of Alaska Cannabis Club", "You may remember Charlo Greene from when she went viral for quitting her job as a reporter on like television while outing herself as the founder of Alaska Cannabis Club. Now living in Los Angeles, Greene says, \"I’m Charlo \"Fuck it, I quit\" Greene, and I’m credited with the legalization of marijuana in Alaska.\" An exceptional entrepreneur, she’s also behind NewCannabisTimes.com and the founder of Go Greene, a cannabis diversity summit series.", "\"I use my connections to pull in as many community leaders of color to come in and share their knowledge, experience and expertise with people that really need a leg up in this industry, and make it mean something for them and their communities,\" says Greene. \"I think a lot of the work that I’m doing is overlooked because I am a woman and because I am a person of color.\"", "Greene’s success has come with a heavy price that proves the War on Drugs in far from over. \"I’m facing 54 years for creating the Alaska Cannabis Club, so in the meantime, it’s dreary that my life could be over this year,\" she explains. \"But if I stop doing what I know I am here to do, which is share these amazing stories and activate people, then the state has already won.\"", "Greene adds that she didn’t quit her job as a reporter because she hated it, but because she knew there was work to be done in marijuana advocacy: \"There was a community of people that needed someone to be bold and I knew that was me. So I’m gonna continue what I’m doing, just on my own terms with The Weed Show.\"", "Her next court appearance is January 11, and she’s assembled a top-notch legal team and is feeling hopeful, yet knows both America and the weed industry still have insurmountable work to do. \"It will be interesting when they try to drag up club members that literally credit the [Alaska Cannabis Club] for saving their lives. I think the state of Alaska will be on trial just as much as they’re putting me on trial.\"", "5.

Apparently, constant use of Android or iPhone affects sperm count as they have higher emission rate. Environmental pollution also to some extent contributes to low sperm count.

However, according to recent research, this fast-food is also the leading cause for four types of cancer.Hot dogs were introduced by German immigrants in the 19th century and gained their popularity quickly. These days, the hot dog enjoys an iconic status. The WHO (World Health Organization) recently issues a report that suggests all processed meals can cause cancer, including red meat. The hot dogs are made of pork, beef and chicken. Factories often use leftovers from cutting steaks and pork chops as well as edible slaughter by-products such as animal feet or head, fatty tissue and skins.During the process, these ingredients are mixed together, and additives such as sat, corn syrup, nitrates, large amount of salt and chemicals are added. Most of these added ingredients have been continuously linked to cancer. Nitrosamines have been linked to bladder cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer.Data from the American Institute for Cancer Research shows that people who consume a single corn dog daily have a 21% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. Even the organic hot dogs contain nitrites in even higher amounts than in the traditional hot dogs."], "targetTitle": "Foods and Healthy Life: Stop Eating This Food Immediately!

Make the same whoosh sound from Step Two. This concludes the first cycle. Repeat the same process three more times for a total of four renditions.", "In a nutshell: breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight. You must inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. The four-count inhale allows chronic under-breathers to take in more oxygen. The seven-count hold gives the oxygen more time to thoroughly permeate the bloodstream, and the eight-count exhale slows the heart rate and releases a greater amount of carbon dioxide from the lungs.", "Alina Gonzalez, who wrote \" How I Learned to Fall Asleep in Under 1 Minute \" for Byrdie.com, says that 4-7-8 helped her fall asleep amid her nerves and severe anxiety the week before she was scheduled to give the bridesmaid speech at her best friend’s wedding.", "When Gonzalez told her friend that she was having trouble getting to sleep due to a combination of stress and pre-wedding jitters, the bride-to-be, who was a licensed wellness practitioner, told her that the 4-7-8 technique would change her life.

As an emerging medium, messaging is bigger than even Facebook. It’s the most widely used smartphone feature in the U.S., and it’s already taking a bite out of social media. As of the beginning of this year, according to Business Insider’s Intelligence Reports, the top four messaging apps—WeChat, Viber, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp—have already eclipsed the top four social networking apps—Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook and Instagram—in their aggregate monthly active users.", "This rapid growth is also poised to leave the rest of the mobile app ecosystem in the dust. According to eMarketer, more than 1.4 billion consumers were using messaging apps by the end of 2015; that’s 75% of all smartphone users and an increase of 31.6% over the previous year. And that number has grown rapidly since. As of this week, Facebook Messenger has already amassed 900 million users on its own. At a time when most smartphone users download zero apps per month and a quarter of all downloaded apps are abandoned after a single use, users are spending an average of 200 minutes a week on WhatsApp.", "So, this is clearly a medium we should pay attention to. But how should publishers and news organizations play with it? To answer that question, we need to grasp what it is about messaging that’s allowed it to become pervasive, so that we can gain a better understanding of how content could fit comfortably on it.", "Why Messaging Is Different", "Text messages—the ubiquitous kind that are primarily used by consumers on their mobile devices—more aptly mimic the fluidity of human communication than other digital forms. The technology embedded in text messages sits in the background versus in your way. For instance, you can respond to a text message immediately or whenever is most convenient for you. It doesn’t require conversing parties to be available simultaneously, as a phone call or video chat does, nor does it assume that people would rather correspond asynchronously, as with email.", "Text messages also offer a better representation of a person’s relationships by focusing on long-term conversations. Messages are typically organized in a list form that is automatically updated every time you interact with it. The people you talk to most frequently and recently at any given moment surface at the top of that list. You don’t have to manually program and repeatedly update the list in the way you may have back when you added your friends and family members to phone-based speed dial, or in the way you need to tell Facebook which friends are closer to you than others, a status that can change from time to time.", "Also, in the context of the text message thread, a message you receive carries the expectation that you will engage with it. In this fundamental way, messaging differs from push notifications or alerts, which instead serve to simply broadcast information. The expectation with an alert is that as soon as you interact with it, it goes away. As soon as you interact with a text message, it sits at the top of your messaging list.", "This focus on fluidity and conversation allows text messaging to more adequately fit the demands of our dynamic circumstances and relationships than other forms of digital communication. To successfully engage with the medium, therefore, publishers should harness these unique features that have made messaging powerful.", "Cost Center or Revenue Stream?", "Publishers will also need to know if messaging offers a clear path—or at least a dimly lit one—to monetization in order to see how widely they can experiment and whether this new outlet will represent a new cost center or revenue stream. While it’s too early to tell, there are a few unique related aspects that are potentially promising.", "By virtue of it living on your phone messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data.", "By virtue of it living on your phone, natively harnessing an ongoing memory of your conversations and serving as the best digital representation of your relationships, messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data. For instance, Facebook Messenger is aware of your identity, social graph, location, conversation history and more. This ongoing memory—coupled with the fact that users are already becoming increasingly comfortable with making payments on their mobile devices—positions in-messaging payment services as potential facilitators of paywalled content. Once they set up their relationship with a service like Stripe or Facebook Messenger’s native payments feature, users can theoretically convert to paying subscribers with a quick text versus detailing their personal and financial information at every point of sale. This could make payments via messaging more effortless than they are to facilitate via websites.", "This unique access to data also allows for messaging to support personalized and perhaps more appropriate user interactions with sponsors. As opposed to simply serving banner ads that may feel disruptive to the conversational experience, messaging apps have the potential to serve offers based on a user’s preferences. In this vein, Facebook Messenger revealed that it will be experimenting with sponsored messages.", "Since preserving a personal tone is essential to the messaging experience, publishers and advertisers will likely explore this area cautiously, so we will hopefully see more intuitive exercises in commercialization using this new medium. For instance, since Facebook Messenger may already know of some services and companies you \"like\" via the data you have fed the parent platform over time, it will probably prioritize facilitating messages between you and those companies you already trust and may want to hear from. On the flip side, if an advertiser gets too noisy or feels irrelevant, you can easily block them from messaging you again.", "Editorial Experiments", "Before monetizing it, publishers need to test the medium itself. The most obvious, lowest-friction way to experiment within messaging platforms is to simply focus on them as new distribution points for content that’s already been created. Predictably, many big publishers have dipped their toes in this way; for instance, The Economist and Buzzfeed both experimented with the messaging app Line to push out news alerts that include links back to their respective publications for the full stories. Setting up this type of experience is similar to using Twitter to alert users; simply create an account on a text messaging app, allow users to subscribe to that account and either manually send out notifications or set up automated news alerts.", "While easy and cheap to fulfill, this use case renders an experience that’s closer to that of a billboard than a conversation, which is why The Economist deemed the exercise a \"brand building initiative.\" Since the user can’t really interact with the message, at best this experiment’s results will be commensurate with the effort, and at worst, they may mirror punishment by way of a slow release of the entire works of Shakespeare over text.", "In taking a step towards experimenting with the conversational aspect of messaging, some publishers have run efforts like live editorial commentary. In this paradigm, a publication’s staff members chat amongst themselves—for instance, discussing a news event—and the subscribed audience can follow the conversation as it unfolds and maybe even participate in the discussion.", "The Guardian hosted a WhatsApp chat alongside the GOP debates in December, and The Huffington Post ran a similar effort around various news topics on Viber. Another related use case involving editorial conversation is acting out a script. The BBC recently used Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play using actual quotes from people involved in the case.", "As in the news alert use case, for this type of experience publishers need to create accounts on messaging platforms and build their subscriber bases. But this experiment also calls for extra time commitments from editorial staffers to write scripts and/or run the live chats. It can also require an outside trigger event, like a debate, to be happening concurrently on another screen that chat subscribers are also tuning in to.", "Chatbots", "While potentially engaging, hosting live conversations on messaging apps is resource-intensive and limited in its interaction with end users, as editors can’t scale themselves to respond to every user’s question or comment. This problem has prompted publishers to experiment with chatbots to allow users to interact with the news.", "In the context of text messaging, a bot is an account operated by software in place of a person. Given a pre-prescribed set of rules a human editor makes, a bot can theoretically respond to a user in a way that mimics a human response. Quartz recently released a news app that sends a user a blurb about a story and employs a bot to ask the user to select between reading more about that specific story or moving on to the next story.", "Forbesbot on Telegram", "CNN created a similar bot on Facebook Messenger using the just-released Send and Receive API, and publications like Forbes and TechCrunch have created bots on the messaging platform Telegram using bot creator Chatfuel. Purple is yet another similarly powered bot that texts users with election news, allowing them to delve deeper into a subtopic within a message by texting back a pre-designated keyword (e.g., \"Kasich\") contained within that original bot message. Powering these experiences relies on a diligent, combined effort of developing a bot (frequently via a third party) and dedicating editorial resources to writing short, conversational prose out of published stories.", "In its current state, the news bot is a novelty that more closely mimics the experience of interacting with an automatic phone teller than talking to a human journalist. The seemingly endless loop of repeatedly hitting buttons or expressing keywords in order to get a response to a specific question can leave a user quickly fatigued. The underlying problem is that bots are essentially formulas created to handle a limited set of scenarios within a pre-defined framework, and they haven’t gotten to the point where they can manage massive banks of scenarios smoothly enough to handle every-day decisions.", "This problem isn’t so different from why, with self-driving vehicles, \"We’re clearly pretty close to making a car that can handle highway driving with no human input, since the range of possible events is pretty small,\" says Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. \"But driving in central Rome or Moscow is an entirely different matter that needs an entirely different level of decision-making: What does that hand gesture mean?\"", "To handle the multitude of scenarios presented in an open-ended system like chat, we need a far more sophisticated bot that can scalably and quickly run decisions based on all potential user inputs, a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that can more holistically mimic human conversations.", "The current limitations of chatbots haven’t stopped messaging platforms like Telegram, Kik and Facebook Messenger from launching their own bot ecosystems, nor have they hindered publications like The Washington Post from creating their own homegrown bots. The promise of true AI—an interaction framework that would allow news providers to offer each of their users a bespoke conversational experience at scale—is far too meaningful to give up on. That’s why, in tandem with releasing its limited-scope Send and Recieve API for bot creators, Facebook has also released Bot Engine, a system based on machine learning that can pave the way for more complex scenarios, like handling different variations of the same user questions.", "AI-powered News", "Looking to the future, you can imagine an AI-based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language, a bot that you can have long-term discussions with about the news the way you would with a well-informed friend. This intelligent bot could also fulfill the promise of voice-based products like Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa. It would both learn who you are and understand the content within stories enough to surface news you’d likely be interested in, whether or not you explicitly told it you were—or perhaps before you even knew you were. This type of bot would be promising in the sense that it may change the current rut we are in with digital news, a relationship which Twitter’s co-founder and Medium founder Ev Williams aptly describes as \"stuck in ... the idea that [the media people consume] is what they want.\"", "Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have?", "While we don’t currently have AI-powered news, we can start paving the way for it by crafting the right type of conversation-based frameworks for it. What’s exciting about this for writers and journalists is that the archetype text messaging is based on—broadly described as conversational user interface (UI)—is largely driven by exposing functionality through language; ‘designing’ a killer chatbot, therefore, relies at least as much on using the right kind of language as it does on a creating a great graphical user interface. Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have?", "Unlike websites and mobile apps, which rely heavily on navigational design and buttons to express breadth of coverage and direct users to the content they may be interested in, with chatbots \"all of your features need to be reachable solely through words—so picking the right thing to say, and the tone of your dialogue with the user, is crucial,\" explains Matty Mariansky, who created MeeKan, a calendaring bot for enterprise messaging platform Slack. This new role of language can empower writers to design experiences for messaging-based services. For instance, Mariansky hired dedicated scriptwriters to come up with more than 2,000 sentences to handle a meeting request.", "While Mark Zuckerberg argues that the best messaging experiences will combine conversational and graphical UI rather than rely on words alone, the role of language as a form of user experience design becomes even more important when we start designing our bots to be flexible enough to work with both text and voice. When the bot is stripped of a screen altogether, as with services like Siri and Alexa, language is the user experience.", "It wouldn’t be far-fetched, therefore, to imagine a scenario in which journalists extend their writing skills and editorial judgment to not only cover stories, but design the channels through which these stories are distributed. These writers may also be critical to the development of an entirely new bot-influenced lexicon, introducing new words and phrases into our vernacular and, through them, new ways for users to interact with the news.", "This type of shift—the ability for writers and publishers to design digital experiences with the same skill set used to hone their journalistic craft—could profoundly change their current shaky relationship with digital products and news distribution and, in turn, with their monetization streams and readers. Journalists don’t have to sit back and watch this bot story unfold.

That is, all 142 virtual monsters that users have confirmed seeing in the wild of North America.", "So now what?", "Off on an international trip to catch the Pokémon elsewhere in the world — underwritten by an international travel company.", "Marriott Rewards has offered to sponsor Johnson to go to Europe, Japan and Australia to catch the regionally based Pokémon and finish his collection, he told USA TODAY Friday. A Marriott spokesman confirmed the trip.", "​Using GPS and augmented reality, the game developed by Niantic Labs invites players to catch the colorful Pokémon monsters best known from Nintendo games and trading cards of the 1990s. In the game, the monsters appear on real-life sidewalks and park benches when a player has the app open — a scenario that's encouraged a mass public-walking binge by millions.", "\"I feel great,\" Johnson said. \"I was getting a lot of rest and exercise and meeting new people.

He's even recently co-authored a book about the platform business model.", "He said his passion for platforms like these are a big part of what motivated him to play the game as much as he did. Beside growing up playing the Pokémon games, of course.", "But staying out till 5 a.m. isn't what Johnson considers to be the most drastic measure he took for Pokémon, citing a story of trying to catch a Porygon. He said when he noticed there was one close-by, he went to search for it, but the Pokémon Go radar was down so he had to order an Uber drive to drive him around until he eventually found it.", "\"That is above and beyond anything else I did to catch one,\" Johnson said. \"I was close to the end so it was extra motivation.\"", "As for other fellow trainers hoping to catch them all, his first piece of advice is to talk to trainers for tips on where to find certain Pokémon.", "\"I probably wouldn’t be here, having caught them all, if I hadn't got those great tips like the Dratinis in Jersey City,\" Johnson said.", "Secondly, always make sure you walk in a straight line when trying to hatch an egg because the game uses a distance displacement calculation so walking in circles or zigzags won't do you any good.", "\"I learned that the hard way,\" Johnson said.", "For now, he's playing casually as something fun to do with his girlfriend and friends but is pouring his energy back into Applico.

Still, the game was well-received by critics, and a cult fan base has been vocal enough that a sequel was announced in 2008. In the years since, an HD remake of the original came out in 2011, but we haven’t heard much about the purported sequel. Is it still in the works? Will it really see the light of day?

If you happen to fit into the target audience, chances are you’re well aware of this long-running series.", "The original Kingdom Hearts came out for PlayStation 2 in 2002 and has seen seven sequels in the interim. So it’s kind of strange that the series hasn’t managed to produce a third official installment, instead sticking to prequels, remakes, and — some would say — filler. Never fear.

The 13th installment in particular didn’t exactly light the world on fire. In fact, most fans of the series would agree that it’s been a slow downhill slide since Final Fantasy X came out in 2001.", "Developer Square Enix is looking to fix that tarnished reputation by releasing a Big Important Game for the series’ 15th installment.

First off, it’s a terrific series of shooters that tells a great story. In fact, the series really laid the groundwork for all story-based shooters to come. It’s no stretch to say that the original Half-Life was probably the first shooter to tell a story worth following at all.", "Making matters worse, however, is that the last installment, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, which came out in 2007, ended on a major cliffhanger. But instead of continuing that series and playing off that story’s big ol’ hanging thread, Valve shifted its efforts to the (also excellent) Portal series.

I then returned to Swoggi to try to win something else, with my remaining credits. And this time, I went directly to the big prize: an iMac 21.5 inches, worth £1150. The competition with other members of the site was tougher than for the iPad Pro, but I still managed to get it, achieving an even better discount: the iPad Pro at only £91.04! This site is truly one of a kind!", "Once again, the delivery was quick and the customer service really helpful!

The streamliners of the 1930s, such as the Chrysler Airflow, had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance.", "But the Airflow and other streamlined American models were commercial failures, outsold by bigger, boxier cars. Through the 1970s, almost every American-made car had hard, sharp edges, with few curves. They were uniformly designed as a series of three connected boxes: the hood, the cabin, and the trunk.", "In Europe, though, fuel was always more expensive, and designers — especially in Germany — explored aerodynamic designs much earlier on, says Penny Sparke, author of A Century of Car Design. In the 1960s and '70s, luxury automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz were some of the first to reintroduce curved exteriors.", "One of the earliest, most well-known examples is the Porsche 911, which was pretty curvy way back when it was introduced in 1963:", "This aesthetic eventually became associated with these luxury cars, both in Europe and in the US, where they arrived as imports. And inevitably, writes historian David Gartman in Auto Opium: A Social History of American Automobile Design, \"American automakers began to copy the European aerodynamic aesthetic in the mid-1980s as a way of courting upscale consumers.\"", "Ford, more than any other company, was responsible for bringing this design change to the mass market. Designer Uwe Bahnsen did it first in Europe with the 1982 Ford Sierra, which was far more curved than similar cars of its era:", "Reviewers panned the look (nicknaming it the \"jelly mould\"), and the car did not sell well at first. Over time, though, buyers got used it — especially as other manufacturers eventually copied the style for their own cars.", "In the US, Ford designer Jack Telnack — who'd worked on the company's European design team before taking over North American design in 1980 — was most directly responsible for the shift to curves. His 1983 Ford Thunderbird design was heavily shaped by wind tunnel testing, prioritizing aerodynamic lines. The look soon filtered down to the mass market with the 1986 Taurus:", "It might look unremarkable today, but the design was positively futuristic at the time. The car was even used in the movie RoboCop, which was supposed to take place in the near future. The Taurus, writes Gartman, \"was definitely aiming at the upscale market of young, well-educated buyers to whom the BMW appealed.\"", "The strategy worked. The Taurus was a huge hit, with massive sales that saved the struggling company — and inspired a wave of copycat American cars.", "Automakers had to improve fuel economy", "Part of the reason the curvy look proliferated so quickly and is still with us today is basic physics. Curved exteriors and more steeply pitched windshields make for less wind resistance, as air can flow more easily over them. This means less gas has to be burned to move the car the same distance at the same speed.", "Right as the Taurus premiered, automakers were dealing with Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for the first time. Starting in 1978, the average fuel economy of each manufacturer's passenger car fleet sold in the US had to reach higher and higher levels, before plateauing in 1990 at 27.5 miles per gallon.", "While automakers had already achieved some gains in efficiency with improved engines and other components, the new curved aesthetic made it much easier and cheaper to achieve further improvements. \"One Ford designer claimed that while it would cost $200 to $300 million to achieve a one-tenth-mile-per-gallon increase by engineering 'under the hood,' aero design achieved a three- to four-tenths m.p.g. increase for almost nothing,\" Gartman writes.", "Automakers began relying more heavily on wind tunnels and aerodynamic calculations when designing their cars, and engineers started working more closely with designers. Within just a few years, virtually every car on the market suddenly looked like the once-futuristic Taurus. \"They all looked the same because they were all being shaped in the wind tunnel, and were designed for fuel economy,\" says Larry Edsall, the author of several books on car design history.", "Technology made it easier to produce curves", "A few key technological developments made these designs possible — and have since allowed automakers to make their cars curvier and curvier.", "For decades, designers had made car models using clay, wood, or other physical materials. During the 1980s, they began using computer models.", "\"It's much easier to make these sorts of shapes with computer drawings, rather than wood,\" Sparke says. \"They gave automakers the means to produce those very soft curves.\" Manufacturing technologies also made it easier and cheaper to produce curved shapes in aluminum than before.", "As a result, since that initial shift in the 1990s, exteriors have only become curvier. You can get a good sense of how profound the change has been by looking at a newer car thought to be remarkably boxy: the Scion xB.", "Sure, it has a big, blocky hatchback. But its edges are still way more rounded than the truly boxy cars of the '80s — and even the groundbreaking, futuristic 1986 Ford Taurus.", "Verge Video: This is the driverless future Mercedes Benz thinks we'll have in the year 2030"], "targetTitle": "Why cars went from boxy in the '80s to curvy in the '90s", "targetDescription": "The story behind the most underappreciated design shift in automotive history.", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53521487/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_2.18.56_PM.0.png", "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3778782/1280px-Sierra_3_door_-_an_early_one.jpg", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53529619/_94928968_originalpic.0.jpg", "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53525779/zeldabreath.0.jpg", "https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53484121/medicine1.0.jpg", "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779182/1280px-2008_Scion_xB.jpg", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3778670/1280px-1934ChryslerAirflow.jpg", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53527277/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_6.39.44_PM.1488585270.png", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53525779/zeldabreath.0.jpg", "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779596/GettyImages-537571797.0.jpg", "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3778714/1280px-Porsche_911E_ca_1969.jpg", "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53519805/shutterstock_554313283.0.jpg", "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3778804/1280px-1st_Ford_Taurus_GL_sedan.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNbPdMLpZzB6TfKl0voz4_hJU6A=/33x0:700x371/1080x600/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46514026/Screen_Shot_2015-06-10_at_5.50.34_PM.0.0.png", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53520017/625496290.0.jpg", "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779228/5892655822_2ccb375564_o.jpg", "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53527277/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_6.39.44_PM.1488585270.png", "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779368/GettyImages-783770.jpg", "https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53532165/arnold.0.png", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779340/GettyImages-103232313.jpg"], "targetUrl": "http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8762373/car-design-curves", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "better aerodynamics which leads to better fuel economy. duh.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes."], "spoilerPositions": [[[4, 20], [4, 226]]], "tags": ["passage"]}

Photo: Adam Pretty", "Critics and social media have predecessor. Critics and social media have savaged NBC ’s early coverage of the Rio Olympics — and the early ratings verdict from Nielsen has not been any kinder. Viewership for the first three nights of the Peacock’s prime-time broadcasts is down sharply compared to both the 2012 London and 2008 Beijing games, with younger audiences bailing in particularly big numbers. It’s not all bad news: Tens of millions of Americans are still watching the Olympics, some viewing has likely shifted to online platforms not immediately measured by Nielsen, and Sunday’s swimming-centric schedule resulted in a big ratings surge. But if the early pattern holds, Rio will be the first summer Olympics since Sydney 2000 to score lower Nielsen numbers than itspredecessor.", "The first sign of trouble for NBC ’s Rio ratings came Saturday morning, when data for Friday’s never-ending opening ceremony came in. Per Nielsen, the minimalist curtain-raiser notched a 13.9 household rating (i.e., the percentage of homes with TV sets tuned to the Olympics). While that’s more than two times the audience for the typical episode of the summer’s No. 1 series, NBC ’s America’s Got Talent , it represents an eye-popping 35 percent drop from night one of the London games (which notched a 21.0 rating) and the lowest rating for an opening ceremony in at least 20 years. (The runner-up? Athens 2004, which averaged a 14.6 rating.) Worse, the 13.9 rating is just barely ahead of the average edition of NBC ’s Sunday Night Football last fall (12.9) rating.", "Things didn’t improve much on Saturday, the first night of competition: NBC averaged an 11.4 for its prime-time broadcast, down about 28 percent from London’s 15.8 and another at least 20-year low. Part of the problem is big defections among millennial audiences, i.e. the audience segment most likely to be turned off by NBC ’s non-stop commercial breaks. Final numbers aren’t in yet, but among adults aged 18 to 34, it looks like Friday’s opening was down around 43 percent compared to London (versus the aforementioned 35 percent decline among viewers of all ages). Perhaps some of that audience shifted to NBC ’s livestream simulcast, but given how much of the network’s ad revenue is tied to linear ratings, that won’t be of much comfort to Peacock accountants. Still, expect NBC to play up big gains for digital and other platforms when it releases so-called \"total audience\" measurement data later this week.", "It’s also far too early to declare Rio any sort of ratings disaster. NBC ’s Olympics ratings often rise and fall based on how well the U.S. team is doing at any given time, and Sunday’s stellar swimming performances by Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps — telegraphed by social media ahead of their broadcast to American audiences — delivered a massive Nielsen boost for NBC . Early numbers show the network’s prime-time coverage jumping to a best-yet 15.9 household rating, the first time since Athens 2004 that a night three of the Olympics has come in ahead of the opening ceremonies. What’s more, while viewership was still down compared to London, it fell a more modest 20 percent and looks to be above tune-in for the comparable nights in both Athens and Sydney.

The trip was full of surprises: lizards in our suitcase, a couple days on islands with no Wi-Fi (and no English), and days spent doing yoga on the beach to round it all out. But what was perhaps the most baffling part of the whole thing was the one question I was asked again and again from fellow moms: \"Who is watching your kids?\"", "If I were a single mother, the question might be valid. But as a married mom whose husband has an equal hand in raising our brood to adulthood, it's quite astonishing to be asked that question again and again. No, I didn't hire a babysitter (at least not for the nights or weekends). No, I didn't leave them with the grandparents. My husband was with them.", "Why would anyone find this shocking?", "OK, so it's true. The list of daily tasks for the care and upkeep of three children is seemingly endless — from the moment they leap out of bed between 7 and 7:15 to the moment they hit the pillows around 8 or 8:30. The 2-year-old must be changed, washed, brushed, soothed, fed, held, rocked, amused, and watched multiple times a day. My 9-year-old and 7-year-old have homework to supervise, friend dramas to negotiate, permission slips to sign, and activities to attend. They dress and bathe themselves, but someone must be vigilant at all times to keep them on track.", "Most Popular", "Truth be told, I work part-time, so the bulk of the child duties does fall to me. But my husband knows the score. He is responsible for preschool drop-off every morning. He picks up from gymnastics every Wednesday, and takes charge of math homework and making sure our son reads for exactly 20 minutes every night. He changes diapers and also has access to the giant family calendar that hangs in our mudroom to track everyone's doctors appointments, playdates, birthday parties, and after-school activities. I might be behind the wheel mostly, but he's always next to me in the front seat reading the map.", "So why the question?", "Our society is full of all kinds of families, but our leafy suburb just outside of New York City often feels like there is one kind: traditional two-parent homes where one parent (usually the dad) works full-time while the long-suffering mother does everything with her kids. When I went on a business trip for a week two years ago, a friend confided in me: \"My husband wouldn't even be able to pack a lunch if I left.\"", "Why are we accepting this as normal?", "My husband regularly goes to California for work. Last year, there were long periods where he left every Tuesday and returned on Friday afternoon. Not once, in all those weeks of lonely nights and busy mornings, did anyone ask him who was watching the kids. It's obvious, right? Daddies get to go out in the world. Mommies stay home. Mommy has it all under control. And I do. Mostly. But it's not easy when one spouse travels. A job that really belongs to two people suddenly falls to one. It's a fact my husband understands well.", "This is why I needed a vacation. Alone.", "\"How long are you gone again?\" he texted me on Wednesday, six days into my 11-day trip.", "I had to laugh. But that is all I did. Because I knew that back home, even though he felt like he was drowning, he would doggy paddle his way back to shore somehow. My toddler's cot sheet might not get washed for preschool. And my son might get a B on a spelling test instead of his usual A, because my husband doesn't ride him as hard as I would've if I was home. But my children would be clean, well-fed, and (mostly) smiling when I got back. And they were.", "My husband is not a babysitter. He is a parent just like me.

But that doesn't make Daddy less capable of it.", "Upon my return, a friend said she could \"never do what you did.\" Her husband wouldn't be able to keep it together.

In fact, Epic Games even recently called Microsoft out on trying to \"monopolize\" PC gaming with its Universal Windows Platform initiatives. Although Microsoft has lost sight of what PC gamers want in recent years (see: Games for Windows Live), there’s no doubt that the current Xbox head Phil Spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the Xbox One into Windows 10. In contrast, Valve’s attempts at making Linux not only the best place to play games from your Steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. Despite making an effort with SteamOS, it doesn’t help that a number of companies still haven’t released their November 2015-bound Steam Machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system’s handicaps. There’s a clear winner here, and unless Linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the OS to beat for PC gaming will remain Windows 10.

At the beginning of April the FreeBSD project released version 10.3 of their operating system. The release announcement for FreeBSD 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. Specifically the availability of ZFS boot environments, 64-bit Linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. I was especially eager to try out FreeBSD’s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. The iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) Warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. One of the first things I wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. For those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. Before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. This gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. We then perform any changes or upgrades we want. When we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. This allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. This makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. The PC-BSD and openSUSE projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. The next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit Linux compatibility. FreeBSD has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run Linux executables. There are some restrictions though. For example, up until now the Linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. There is a package in the FreeBSD repository which installs the CentOS core userland software. In essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of CentOS 6 in a directory on our FreeBSD computer. This is handy if we need to run Linux software alongside FreeBSD software or if we want to run Linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. The final feature I wanted to look at was FreeBSD jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older Warden jail management software. Jails on FreeBSD are basically very lightweight virtual machines. Part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. What primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host’s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of FreeBSD. In recent years Docker has provided similar functionality on Linux.

IBM’s POWER9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won’t arrive until late 2016. Whatever CPU you use to run Linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, OrangeFS, XFS, Btrfs and EXT 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while F2FS is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage. Dell’s laptops will play nicer with Linux thanks to driver changes that permit hotkeys to be pressed into service. Raspberry Pi users may appreciate new drivers that are said to do lovely things for 3D graphics performance. More at The Register", "Did you miss a roundup?

One of her secret savings accounts had grown to $900 behind her back.", "Rhoads, a 37-year-old Los Angeles-based sales director for a jewelry line, has an account with Digit, a financial technology company with an algorithm that tracks users’ income and spending patterns. It painlessly spirits small amounts of money out of checking and into a savings account every two or three days. ", "\"I just thought it was such a good idea, to set it and forget it,\" said Rhoads, who says she is \"like a squirrel\" in her approach to saving. Digit sends texts with balance updates, which she largely ignores because \"I like to pretend the saving is not happening.\" ", "Getting consumers comfortable with putting their finances on customized autopilot, starting with a simple, no-fee—and no-interest—savings account, is the San Francisco startup’s mission. In two years, its users have saved more than $350 million this way, according to its 31-year-old founder and chief executive officer, Ethan Bloch. When the product moved out of pilot mode, in February 2015, users were saving about $1 million a month; now that’s more than $35 million a month. Digit won’t disclose the size of its user base but says it has tripled from about a year ago.", "Digit had a savings bot before bots were cool, or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch. Its product is simple. An algorithm looks at a user’s average, high, and low checking account balance, when the user is paid, and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy. Then, after looking for bills due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending, it moves an amount it judges the customer won’t miss to a savings account. The company makes money from the interest rate it gets on account assets.", "Digit announced today that it will be the first savings bot on Facebook Messenger’s platform, so users can just use Facebook to communicate with it. When Digit moved out of its pilot phase, it communicated only by text, a natural language for many users, since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24, and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 years old. Rhoads said they’re \"cute texts\" with \"some personality\" and \"not annoying at all.\" After text messaging came iOS and Android apps for users.", "The company is now working on what Bloch called \"the first artificial intelligence-powered financial goal program.\" Users would set a date and amount (and pick an emoji, of course), and Digit’s algorithm would make a series of projections based on balances to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal—or point out that the goal is unrealistic.", "Also on the product horizon is having Digit’s algorithm figure out how to \"move every dollar where it should go, at the right time, to minimize fees [on student loans, credit card  accounts, etc.] and maximize gain,\" Bloch said. ", "There are hitches. Since Digit isn’t a bank, it can’t pay interest, and it will be competing in an environment of rising rates. Bloch said interest rates \"are not a huge deal\" for his customers, because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sums.", "Another hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect accounts. \"Banks have not made it easy for customers to get their data,\" Bloch said. \"Because of that, Digit and products like Acorns, Venmo, Betterment—every day we have bank difficulties that affect thousands of customers.\"", "Behavioral finance underlies much of Digit’s design. Take the goal function, for example: If users get more specific about what they are saving for, research suggests, they are less likely to withdraw the money.", "\"If an account is labeled 'Charlie’s Education Fund,' I’ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it’s just labeled 'Savings,'\" Bloch said. Currently, 70 percent of Digit users withdraw 80 percent of their savings every 90 days, mainly to pay bills and meet short-term needs for cash, to pay off debt, or pay for travel.", "Bloch's broadest long-term goal is to make Digit’s user interface far more conversational, to \"humanize it\" so users feel more in control when they communicate with it.", "\"We want to make Digit understand more—not as broad as Alexa or Siri, but widen the aperture a little more—related to finances and your money,\" he said. \"One day, it would be awesome to say, ‘Hey, Digit, am I OK for retirement?’ And all Digit does is send back a thumbs-up emoji.\"", "That kind of complex analysis won’t show up anytime soon. But after a Series B round of fundraising led by venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, Digit’s 22-person team is sitting on $25 million in cash. That, Bloch said, will let the company \"be somewhat protected for the next few years in pushing the envelope, largely to invest in product development.

The film illustrates many aspects of biology, perhaps most memorably when Raquel Welch ventures out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecules, which recognise her as a foreign invader and try to destroy her.", "The antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body. For an immunologist Fantastic Voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked", "One, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape – to forestall future invasions – before destroying it. The alternative – clonal selection theory – says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. Each B cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. When a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one B cell will recognise it. That B cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. These newly cloned B cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction.", "The instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling , while Macfarlane Burnet (also a Nobel Prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection . The makers of the film followed Pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and Welch made for better cinema isn’t clear. However, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument.", "Nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw. Scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen. In the 1930s Karl Landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally.", "This led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist. This would require billions of different antibodies. And as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes. But there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible.", "The GOD problem", "in several In the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory. This led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded. It was termed the \"generation of diversity\", or GOD problem. The GOD problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted Nobel Prizes . Scientists showed that GOD was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of DNA in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of DNA sequences", "The difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies. And some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications. Perhaps most notably César Milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens. He wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate B cells to make antibodies. He could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time. In doing so he developed, together with Georges Köhler in 1975, a method that made B cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody", "Milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine. The impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense. Because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests. They have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . In economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of US$75 billion in 2013.", "In an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question. Scientists are motivated to develop new techniques to answer important questions. They often later find that these techniques have important practical applications beyond their original purpose.

Judge grew up in Linden, California, about two hours from what was then Pac Bell Park.", "\"I was a Giants fan and that was the time he was putting up 70 homers a year,\" said Judge, who's now a 6-foot-7, 282-pound right fielder for the New York Yankees. \"That was pretty impressive to watch as a kid.\"", "On Wednesday, Judge will celebrate his 25th birthday by playing his first game in the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. He will step to the plate as a rookie sensation; his six homers are tied for the second most in the American League.", "But it's not just about how many balls he has hit over the fence -- it's how far he has hit them. Judge is challenging the current champ, Giancarlo Stanton, as the king of the XXXL home run.", "Judge’s 460-foot homer on Saturday in Pittsburgh was the third longest for a Yankee since ESPN started tracking distances in 2009. Only Alex Rodriguez's 477-foot homer in August 2015 and Juan Miranda's 469-foot shot in October 2009 traveled farther. In the past two seasons, Judge has three of the four longest Yankee homers. Only Chase Headley, with a 453-footer in July 2016, cracks the top four. Headley believes he got all of that one, but he said he and his teammates are eager to see what would happen if everything clicks in perfectly for Judge.", "\"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it,\" Headley said. \"I want to see him do that. He is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. Five hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. If there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550.\"", "Starlin Castro, who is usually in the same batting practice group as Judge, has never been big on watching teammates or opponents take BP.

It is really motivating. It is really fun to watch. We feel like every swing he takes, something big is going to happen.\"", "Matt Holliday, on the other hand, has always studied standout teammates and opponents in BP as if there'd be an exam afterward. It's not just tape-measure specialists, but contact guys too. Holliday looks for any little ingredient he can add to his game, making the 37-year-old slugger as qualified as anyone to weigh in on Judge’s power.", "\"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it ...

Barry Bonds, too.\"", "Holliday has seen Stanton do his damage only as an opponent, while he receives a daily dose of Judge. He said it might just be familiarity, but he would take Judge in a distance contest.", "Mark Teixeira, who just completed a 14-year career in which he swatted 409 homers, said he used to watch Nelson Cruz launch some balls in the Arlington heat when they were teammates in Texas. In 2013, Teixeira played with Stanton in the World Baseball Classic.", "\"Judge’s power is right there with those two guys,\" said Teixeira, now an ESPN analyst.", "In 2016, Judge struck out in 42 of his 84 at-bats, a performance so bad it made the Yankees hesitant to hand him the right-field job in spring training, even with a full winter endorsement from team owner Hal Steinbrenner. In the final days, the Yankees finally gave Judge the nod over Aaron Hicks. Judge has struck out 17 times in 61 at-bats thus far.", "\"I knew it was going to take some time for him to get used to minor league pitching and big league pitching and really grow into his swing, because he is a big guy and he has to grow into his strike zone,\" Teixeira said. \"The smarter he has gotten about swinging at certain pitches and the more ready he is at the plate, he looks like he is so dangerous right now. He is exactly where you would hope he would be when I saw him a few years ago.\"", "It's early, but Judge has joined Stanton as a player you can’t miss.

And I know for sure, there are other Chinese parents who are doing the same to their children right now.

As a child, Calvin attended Chinese school on the weekends and excelled in Mandarin. However, as he grew up, Calvin began distancing himself from his parents’ cultural traditions and values.", "As a teenager, Calvin strove to be more Americanized and had no interest in eating out at Chinese restaurants with his parents, listening to Chinese news or traveling to Asia. He wanted to break away from the kind of stereotypes that are linked to Asian Americans such as academic excellence in math and science. Li said:", "\"So his [Calvin’s] way of doing that was to distance himself from anything Chinese. I felt that’s not the right way of dealing with identity, but at the time I was not aware of this issue. I was not understanding enough to help him. I was just forcefully saying, you know, ‘You’re a Chinese kid.’\"", "Calvin associated with few other Asian students in his social circle and while he maintained good grades, his passion wasn’t academics.

So take in this information and you will see just how many people belong to and feel connected to this community.", "We should point out that there are also some celebs who have been rumored to be gay or lesbian or something else, but the gossip is false, and they wont appear below. One example is singer Selena Gomez. While she doesn’t identify as an LGBTQ individual, she is still happy that she's able to be a positive role model. Are there any names on this list that really surprised you? Feel free to share the list on social media!", "15 Kristen Stewart", "Actress Kristen Stewart was the other half to actor Robert Pattinson for years, and the two were a discrete power couple in Hollywood in the past. Yet in early 2016, Stewart came totally forward and proclaimed her sexuality for all to hear and see. The 26-year-old is now in a romantic relationship with her personal assistant Alicia Cargile, and before that, Stewart was dating Soko, French actress and musician. Just two years ago, Stewart was ending her long-standing relationship with Pattinson, and before that, she was dating another one of her co-stars, Michael Angarano. Stewart and Cargile have only been dating since July of 2016, but Stewart has expressed that she is very happy with their relationship. As for Cargile, she may be a bit more rampant with her sexuality, as she was seen donning a baseball cap that said \"Make America Gay Again.\" It was obviously a direct hit to Presidential candidate, Donald Trump.", "14 Aubrey Plaza", "Who didn’t love watching Aubrey Plaza play Andy’s (Chris Pratt’s) girlfriend April on Parks and Recreation? Plaza plays the perfect cynical Debbie Downer character, but the 32-year-old actress’ unique and distinguishable character traits aren’t the only thing that makes her special. Plaza revealed earlier in 2016 that gender \"isn’t a factor\" for her when it comes to dating and romantic relationships. The actress is perfectly fine getting with someone whether they are a girl, guy, or don’t identify as either. Plaza’s revelation came during an interview with The Advocate, one of the most influential gay news magazines. Plaza did not call herself a bisexual, but she did say that she has a very \"androgynous and masculine\" aura about her, and that tends to attract many different kinds of people, which she is totally cool with. She then blatantly stated that she falls in love \"with girls and guys,\" and that she can’t help it.", "13 Mara Wilson", "Sometimes it takes a tragedy for people to open up about their own struggles. So it was with Mara Wilson, the 28-year-old actress who starred in hit films such as Matilda and Miracle on 34th Street. Wilson was so deeply moved after the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that she Tweeted her emotions and truth for her fans. Wilson wrote \"F*cking hell, Orlando.\" She then referred to a picture of herself ten years ago at a gay nightclub and added the caption: \"I have never had a better experience at a club than I did then...the LGBT community has always felt like home, especially a few years later when I, uh, learned something about myself.\" Wilson then pointed out the Kinsey scale, which some people use as a measurement of one’s sexuality, from 100% straight to 100% homosexual. Wilson stated that she was a 2, meaning that she identifies as a queer and a bisexual.", "12 Colton Haynes", "Actor Colton Haynes started 2016 by unloading a heavy burden about his sexuality. The 27-year-old actor is best known for his role on the MTV series Teen Wolf, and he chose a subtle way to break the news about his sexual orientation. Taking to social media, Haynes commented on a Tumblr post that someone wrote which explained how they were shocked to hear about Haynes’ \"secret gay past,\" and that it got them \"so excited.\" Haynes then responded to the Tumblr post, writing \"Was it a secret? Let’s all just enjoy life & have no regrets.\" Many people have assumed that this was Haynes’ way to publicly coming out as gay, even though he didn’t say he was gay directly. It is safe to say that he took a nonchalant approach and that he no longer has to worry about his sexuality being a secret. He certainly made the Tumblr world happy!", "11 Reid Ewing", "If the name Reid Ewing sounds familiar, that’s because he is one of the famed actors from the hit TV series Modern Family. Ewing plays the role of Dylan, who is a recurring secondary character in the show, which is no stranger to exploring societal norms and challenges, such as same-sex relationships. The 27-year-old actor stepped forward earlier this year to share some serious information about himself. When writing on a guest blog post for HuffPost Healthy Living, Ewing wrote about his struggles with body dysmorphia before taking to Twitter to tell everyone in the chillest way possible that he is gay. His tweet read: \"Saw Eugene Bata on @GMA in the Body Dysmorphia segment connected to my article I just want to say he is hot af.\" Someone commented and asked \"Did you just out yourself?\" to which Ewing replied \"I was never in.\" *Drops mic* That’s the way to do it!", "10 Shane Dawson", "For years, YouTube sensation and funny guy Shane Dawson was suspected of being gay. He would often perform hilarious skits in which he would play flamboyant characters or feisty females. Plus, with his cute emo haircut and his higher-pitched voice, he set off plenty of people’s gaydar. A few months ago, Dawson released a YouTube video on his channel simply titled \"I’m Bisexual.\" In the video, Dawson told his 6 million followers that he had been struggling with his sexual identity for years, and that he wasn’t sure whether he was straight or gay or somewhere in between. He hoped that by releasing his video for his fans, others would realize that they’re not alone in their struggles with sexuality. Stating that, \"I don’t know who I am 100 percent. And I know that a lot of you guys might feel the same way,\" Dawson preferred to call himself a bisexual.", "9 Ryan Beatty", "Another celeb who came out in 2016 was singer Ryan Beatty. The 20-year-old became famous thanks to his stellar YouTube videos that showed off his vocal talent and charming good looks. Beatty then began to break out into the public sphere and could be one of the next great male solo artists. A few months ago, Beatty used social media (fittingly enough, since that’s where he achieved fame) to tell his fans that he was gay. His Instagram post included the words \"raging homosexual\" and \"gay power.\" Beatty stated that it took him two decades to come to terms with his sexuality, but now he is \"comfortable enough to say it\" and \"can finally breathe.\" The singer also took to the Twitterverse and Tweeted: \"i’m so happy i’m gay\" and he also thanked his friends and family for their support. The announcement came right before the release of his single, \"Passion.\"", "8 Rayvon Owen", "Some of you may remember Rayvon Owen from American Idol’s 14th season, on which he was the third runner-up. The 24-year-old singer was nearly guaranteed success in the music world after his American Idol performances, but people were not expecting the star to come out, especially in the way that he did. Owen released a music video for his song \"Can’t Fight It\" earlier this year, and in this video, he explores the concept of his sexuality and how he had to come to terms with it. In \"Can’t Fight It,\" Owen can be seen going through a nightclub, and the sexy vibe lets us know that something’s up. By the end of the music video, Owen has found a guy that suits his fancy. He takes the man’s hand, kisses him, and thus reveals that he is now an openly gay singer. Plus, the other guy in the video was played by Shane Bitney Crone, a pivotal advocate and public figure in the LGBTQ community.", "7 Gloria Vanderbilt", "Famed and respected news journalist for CNN, Anderson Cooper, has been out as a gay man since 2012, but earlier this year he was thrown for a loop when his own mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, dropped some bombshell information. Vanderbilt spoke during a joint interview alongside Cooper and revealed that when she was a teenager, she had a lesbian relationship with one of her classmates. It was a piece of information that had been unknown to Cooper for his entire life, and the way the journalist reacted was downright adorable, as he shrugged his shoulders at his mom and said, \"What? This is news to me.\" Mother and son shared a cute giggle together and Cooper seemed grateful to know that his own mother had experimented with her sexuality. The whole thing was quite touching, and in fact, Vanderbilt wrote a book with her son which was recently published entitled The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son On Life, Love, and Loss.", "6 Nur Warsame", "Nur Warsame is an imam in Australia, and for those of you who don’t know an imam is an Islamic worship or mosque leader in the Muslim faith. Warsame came out at the start of the summer in 2016 and became the first imam in Australia to openly identify as gay. Naturally, Warsame has dealt with an outpouring or both support and hate. There have been a number of mosques in Australia that will not accept Warsame through its doors, while other Muslim leaders have spoken out against Warsame and said that his acceptance of his sexuality is wrong. On the other hand, there have been other leaders and people in the public who have commended Warsame for his actions. Warsame was previously married to a woman and he also has a young daughter. He is now an advocate for other Muslims who may be struggling with their own sexuality.'"], "targetTitle": "15 LGBTQ Celebrities You Didn’t Know Came Out In 2016", "targetDescription": "The LGBTQ community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as LGBTQ or straight supporters who want to help the cause.

As he put it elsewhere: \"A claim for equality of material position can be met only by a government with totalitarian powers.\"", "3. The Closing of the American Mind by Allan Bloom", "Long before anti-MILO rioters sparked violence at UC Berkeley, a University of Chicago professor named Allan Bloom lit academia ablaze with this 1987 classic taking the professoriate to task for eroding higher education curriculum with progressive pablum. A staunch defender of the classical \"canon\" of great works every thinking person must read, Bloom explained how the intellectual corruption of the humanities and arts led to an erasure of students’ understanding of the proper moral order that undergirds Western Civilization.", "4. A Choice Not an Echo by Phyllis Schlafly", "The late great matriarch of modern conservatism, Phyllis Schlafly, did more to advance and win the battle of ideas than many young conservatives understand. The tip of her intellectual spear, A Choice Not an Echo, reshaped the contours of American conservatism and has sold an astounding three million copies since its release over a half-century ago. The original anti-establishment crusader, Schlafly’s book argued that conservatives must be willing to fight for a voice within the Republican Party’s establishment leadership and helped pave a path for Barry Goldwater’s nomination.", "5. Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman", "Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman redefined the field of economics. In addition to being an intellectual titan, he was a sterling writer with a knack for distilling complex topics with wit and clarity. Any Nobel Prize winner who can string together a sentence like this deserves to be read: \"If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there’d be a shortage of sand.\"", "6. A Conflict of Visions by Thomas Sowell", "There are no \"bad\" Thomas Sowell books, so we could have easily recommended many of his other classics. But A Conflict of Visions crystalizes the stakes involved in the clash between conservative and progressive ideologies—and how radically different outcomes are when one side prevails over the other. One of America’s most lucid conservative economists, Sowell’s book draws upon everything from Rousseau to Hobbes to Adam Smith to illustrate the intellectual impulses that drive conservatives and progressives to think and act the way they do.", "7. Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn", "Hailed as one of the greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century, Gulag Archipelago is the first-person account of Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s eight years spent as a prisoner inside the Russian gulags for criticizing Stalin and the Soviet Communist system in his private letters.

(Courtesy Ashok Goel)", "To help with his class this spring, a Georgia Tech professor hired Jill Watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world. Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor’s overworked teaching staff.", "But, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot.", "Ashok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watson’s true identity to students until after they’d turned in their final exams.", "Students were amazed. \"I feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class!\" wrote one in the class’s online forum. \"Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey!\" said another.", "Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesn’t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot’s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don’t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes.", "\"To me this is a grand challenge,\" Goel said. \"Education is such a huge priority for the entire human race.\"", "At the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM.", "Goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course’s online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions.", "As Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit.", "To train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the class’s previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered.", "Goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jill’s answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as \"Where can I find assignment two?\" and \"When is assignment two due?\" Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough.", "\"I cannot create chaos in my classroom. Jill had to be almost perfect as a human TA or I am,\" Goel said.", "The system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate.", "There are many questions Jill can’t handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants.", "Goel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn’t human."], "targetTitle": "What happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant", "targetDescription": "These students were shocked to find out they'd

{"uuid": "0304e695-f5fa-4c5b-a576-2bb72c1e1afd", "postId": "4jhjtg", "postText": ["10 Worthless Collectibles And the Reasons They Lost Their Value"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["Few myths are more common than the idea of collecting as an investment. Unfortunately for these ten examples, the bust has come.", "At one point or another most of us have daydreamed about finding buried treasure up in the attic. Whether it's an old china set, some dusty candlesticks or a copy of the Declaration of Independence, there's always that hope that maybe up among the rubbish is something of real value just waiting to be discovered.", "After all, what could be better than a climate controlled treasure hunt?", "That dream extends into collectibles. From pogs to marbles to Cabbage Patch Kids, most of us tried to collect something at one point or another. For a fewm the passion kept going, until today a few folks have the kind of pop-culture artifacts that will amaze archeologists from future civilizations.", "For the time being, you can probably leave those shoeboxes where they lie though, because the truth is that those old prizes rarely retain much value over time. No matter how high profile, most collections sooner or later become little more than old curiosities, remnants of a fad that only really made sense in a specific time and a particular place.", "Yet perception often lags. When it comes to many collections, people's belief in their value as an investment lingers long after that ceases to be true. What drives the kind of passion that can send prices for laminated cardstock soaring, and what can bring that tumbling back down to Earth? To understand that, it's helpful to look at ten collections that are worth less, sometimes a lot less, than many people think.", "10. Coca-Cola Memorabilia", "As Jim Griffith, an antiquarian and the dean of education for eBay, explained, a few rules guide the price of collectibles. First and foremost is the oldest of all: supply and demand.", "\"It would be a mistake,\" he said, \"not to ascribe to the collectibles market the general rule of market value historically.\"", "That particular rule hit the market for Coca-Cola collectibles hard.", "Back in the 1940s and 1950s, America seemingly couldn't get enough of Coke brand merchandise, and the company obliged, pumping out paraphernalia from clocks and coolers to more exotic fare, such as the iconic gas station pumps and even flatware sets. (Contrary to popular rumor, however, the Smith & Wesson Coke bottle grip was simply named after the shape, not a marketing partnership.) Prices soared for even the most mundane of items as collectors and novices alike grabbed every red and white TV tray they could.", "This also brought prices tumbling back down when those \"collectibles\" were on the shelves of every single dime store in the country. Today, the more elaborate pieces will still fetch a good price, such as the vending machines listed for over $1,000, but most of those Coke-stamped products are now just inexpensive curiosities, available for $5 here and $10 there... if the seller's lucky.", "9. Americana", "With Americana popular around the same time as Coke-brand merchandise, everyone can picture this mid-century craze: Smallville, U.S.A. houses decorated from front to back with American flags and eagles in every shape, size and permutation. Americana collectors slept under Uncle Sam sheets, ate off of patriotic plates and hung their pictures in freedom frames.", "Today? Not so much.", "\"The frenzy of buying American collectibles and American antiques from the mid- and early-century definitely has taken a downturn,\" Griffith said.", "As with virtually all collectibles, the rule isn't absolute. While prices will chase fads for most items, the really high quality or unique pieces will always retain at least some of their value. In fact, for collections past their prime, the truly valuable pieces may even go up in value as sets begin to fade away. As Marsha Dixey, consignment director with Heritage Auctions, explained, value of a collection has more to do with the run of the mill pieces than the truly outstanding ones. Collections become worthless, she said, when the majority of its pieces become little more than knick-knacks that anyone can get.", "\"What things don't have a value anymore that people think should,\" she said. \"is one of those things that's totally driven by the collector group that's no longer interested and has dropped out of the marketplace.\"", "By the time 99% of the pieces are available to anyone who wants them, it ceases to have value as a collection and instead is about singular artifacts.", "8. Roseville Pottery", "Where supply and demand is as old as the concept of trade itself, another major factor in eroding value is something brand new: the internet. It's what wiped out collectors of Roseville Pottery, and it will be back later on this list.", "For years, Roseville Pottery was a collecting craze. While the company itself went out of business in 1954, Roseville's work continued to circulate, gaining value over the years as its work grew in popularity. Whether acquiring pieces at antique shops or roadside dealers, collectors prized every Roseville find they could claim, and as a result, prices shot through the roof.", "Until the internet came along and put a stop to all that, by taking the mystery out of the pot.", "\"One of the things that eBay and the internet did was pull the cover off years of false scarcity in the market,\" Griffith said. \"Suddenly the actual supply situation was revealed. Prior to the internet and sites like eBay, I could go searching in my car to different antique markets and shops, and it was rare. With the internet, I could connect to every piece of Roseville in the world.\"", "What the internet revealed was how much prices depended not just on supply and demand, but also on regional supply and demand. A piece was as valuable as the supply of Roseville pots that the buyer could find, regardless of how many existed in the wide world. When the local antique store has just two pieces in stock, that can drive up some hard bargains. When shoppers can go home and Google up 800 more, not so much...", "7. Thomas Kinkade Paintings", "Another success story brought low by the internet, for a period of time in the '80s and '90s, Thomas Kinkade, the \"Painter of Light,\" was absolutely everywhere.", "Now, to a degree, Kinkade's work was value-driven. His paintings are legitimately attractive, sometimes downright beautiful, and he was doing something with colors and warmth on canvas that didn't really exist in popular culture at that moment. Yet Kinkade was a victim of his own success, creating an entire company out of reprinting his paintings, complete with dedicated franchise galleries across the country and a $110 million IPO in 1994.", "By its peak, Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries had 350 locations across the nation, before its bubble burst in a slow collapse began in the early 2000s, culminating in a bankruptcy filing in 2010.", "What happened? A combination of the two factors we've already discussed: market glut and the internet. As Kinkade flooded the country with his prints, the value of the product in stores increasingly became an illusion. Prices represented how likely you were to find another Kinkade around the block -- \"local scarcity\" as Dixey put it, not how much the piece was objectively worth. The bubble would burst sooner or later, and internet marketplaces did the trick. Once prospective buyers could reach the thousands of works that T.K.S. Galleries had been pumping out for over a decade, the rest was just a matter of time.", "6. Hummel Figurines", "Most people have heard the name \"Hummel\" before. One of the most popular collectibles in American history, Hummel figurines are virtually synonymous with meticulously sorted rows of tchotchkes painstakingly assembled over the years.", "Hummel first started producing its porcelain figurines in 1935 after the drawings of a German nun, Maria Innocentia Hummel. After GI's returned from Germany in the 1940s bearing gifts of these for their wives and girlfriends, the collections began to catch on, because there was enough scarcity to create a legitimate secondary market. No one could go to the shop and just get another, you had to hunt for what limited supply was out there.", "Over the course of the 20th Century, Goebel, the parent company that owned Hummel, decided to break that model. Endless special editions and limited runs proliferated, all based on the proposition that pieces would continue to appreciate in value. Hummels were sold as an investment, while the very act of selling them in bulk undermined the scarcity that made them valuable in the first place.", "Like with Thomas Kinkade's work, eventually buyers could readily find excess product, either from the manufacturer or a flooded secondary market. The value plummeted, and today, while some few retain their value, most are little more than paperweights.", "5. Comic Books", "If flooded markets and the internet have dragged down collections' value, what causes it in the first place? There must be some good reason why otherwise sane people shell out sometimes millions of dollars for a few colored pictures on musty paper.", "The reason, Griffith explained, has much to do with emotion. It is often, he said, about a \"shared cultural moment.\" Collections, especially pop culture or mass produced works, are about the things we form an attachment to en masse. Hummel represented the end of the war years while Thomas Kinkade marketed his paintings to spaces where young couples would splurge on vacation.", "A collectible is ultimately a personal decision that something has value far greater than the cost of its commodity, and prices can shoot up when society decides to embrace that collectively.", "\"There is no greater evidence of that,\" Griffith said, \"than the explosion of the comic book industry into both collecting and media. The idea now that our biggest blockbusters are all based on comic book heroes is not coincidental to the fact that today's audience were all comic book readers when they were younger.\"", "Unfortunately, despite the impression many people have of lost riches in the paperbacks of their youth, the reality is far more mundane. Aside from the highest value items, comic book collections are worth next to nothing these days. (Although Dixey disagreed with that, arguing that comic books \"are probably more solid than if you went out and purchased a very fine piece of Chippendale's Furniture.\")", "4. Commemorative Plates", "For some reason in the mid-century, the idea of memorializing shared moments on dinnerware became huge.", "Historians are still struggling to explain it.", "Nevertheless, plates commemorating ideas such as the Statue of Liberty Centennial, the World Series and Norman Rockwell's paintings exploded as collectibles, often fueled by QVC and late-night television.", "The trouble is that, with no one company acting as the gatekeeper for any of these products, there was never any market scarcity to begin with. Unlike collectibles like Hummel figurines, whose manufacturer could have chosen to produce less, plates such as centennial and Norman Rockwell collections were simply stamped out by any company that had a potential buyer.", "Although billed as a collector's item, these are products that never had any real value to begin with. Today, as the eBay listings show, these are all but worthless, with products such as the Statute of Liberty Centennial Plate selling for $0.99 and most Norman Rockwell ones going for $5 to $15 apiece.", "3. Baseball Cards", "Cards are another quintessential collector's item. Today much of the collector's world has shifted to trading card games, where the granddaddy of them all, Magic the Gathering, can still command enormous value. (A single card from that game can still fetch upwards of $30,000.)", "Baseball cards, on the other hand, frequently disappoint.", "It's not that baseball cards have no value. As long as the sport remains popular, so too will its cards. It's that they have far less value than people assume. While rare or exceptional cards can still fetch a bundle, most baseball cards are worthless. The disappointment settles in when people realize the difference between their expectations and reality. Those carefully hoarded collections from their youth, stacked up pieces of cardboard tucked away and sat on for 20 years, will fetch... well, maybe the price of lunch.", "The reason goes back to cultural moments. America simply doesn't have the love affair with its pastime that we once did. When baseball resonated on an emotional level with almost everyone, collectors could sell their cards to almost anyone, and prices reflected that. Today, as interested has waned, so too has demand.", "\"Those cultural moments change very quickly,\" Griffith said. \"If you think back, it was a year or two ago, the Seth Rogan movie The Interview and all the brew-ha-ha about Sony Pictures not releasing it. That was an interesting cultural moment, it popped up very quickly and then suddenly there were posters on eBay of this movie which looked like it may not be released which were selling for hundreds of dollars.\"", "Today, those posters will go for a few bucks. Baseball fanaticism lasted a lot longer, and may someday be back, but for now, few of those cards are much of an investment.", "2. Beanie Babies", "\"Almost 20 years ago now, Beanie Babies came along ,and it created a furor,\" Dixey said. \"It started at a price point where people could afford to buy it... and then it escalated.\"", "Dixey had a front row seat for the Beanie Baby explosion.", "A brief fad, America practically lived and died on beanie babies for a period of time in the late '90s. For many Millennials, it stands out as the concept of collections as investments-turned-junk bond, and today we still talk about the market for these little plush toys in awe (the most expensive of which went for several thousand dollars).", "As Slate's Mark Stern wrote of his own experience shopping for the plush toys in 1999:", "The Britannia bear wasn't just a toy, we explained", "it was an investment, projected to be worth thousands of dollars within a decade. Our father capitulated and bought us each a Britannia bear, which we dutifully kept in mint condition with the tag intact, reveling in its rarity while dreaming of the day it would be a hugely valuable collector's item.", "One month later, the company that developed Beanie Babies abruptly announced that it would stop producing the toys at the end of the year... Today, the Britannia Beanie Baby sells for $10 on eBay.", "Entire books have been written on the Beanie Bubble, but suffice to say that unless you're sitting on one of the Princess Diana bears (priced on eBay at an aspirational $343,000 to $450,000), that collection is worth, maybe, the gas money down to the Salvation Army.", "1. Lunch Boxes", "On the list of nice dreams, add the idea that the old Fraggle Rock lunch box you used to use for ham sandwiches and Gatorade might help send your kids to college. Now dispense with that notion altogether, because no matter how fiercely some people might seek to line their walls with them, these products just aren't that valuable.", "\"I had some experience oh 15, 18 years ago with lunch boxes and bought and sold quite a number of them,\" Dixey said. \"There were some that were indeed rare, and they were bringing lots of money.\"", "\"Then, all of a sudden, some things started coming out of the woodwork,\" Dixey added. \"You go back to the old adage of supply and demand. All of a sudden there's a glut of them and it brings the price down.\"", "One of the biggest questions in this space is, consistently: why people have such a mismatch between value and expectations. Part of it is simple lack of research, but part, Griffith said, is the very human habit of wishful thinking.", "\"I did a lot of time in the '70s as a picker going around to different homes with another antique dealer looking for merchandise to buy and sell,\" he said. \"What was amazing to me was how many people thought that what they had was way more valuable than it really was, and there was no real way to argue with them, nothing to point to.\"", "Today, increasingly, the bubble is bursting with advent of internet information."], "targetTitle": "10 Worthless Collectibles And the

Photo via Getty", "Reports on the income inequality gap and the separate lives of the wealthy and the poor have become depressingly rote. The rich are not like you or me: They can buy their way into exclusive clubs, special social networks, even elitist sex parties. The poorest people in America are now on average not making enough to meet their basic needs—that sounds pretty bad, but can I interest you in a $700 juicer?", "In that context, the publication, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), of a new study that looks at income and life expectancy after age 40 contains no bombshells. The report, covered widely by the New York Times and pretty much every other outlet on Monday, drills down into how income and longevity correlate. The richest 1 percent of men lives, on average, 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women that gap is ten years. But the ability of money and the things it buys—access to better medical care, leisure time, healthier food—to stave off death is well known. The big finding from Stanford economist Raj Chetty and his seven co-authors is not that rich people live longer, it's that the life expectancies of Americans in poverty varies wildly depending on where they live.", "Here's how the Times summarizes it: \"The poor in some cities—big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.—live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.\"", "For the wealthy, it doesn't matter where they live—they seem to have the access to the same sorts of advantages wherever they go. \"It is as if the top income percentiles belong to one world of elite, wealthy US adults,\" wrote Nobel Prize–winning economist Angus Deaton in an article that accompanied the study in JAMA, \"whereas the bottom income percentiles each belong to separate worlds of poverty, each unhappy and unhealthy in its own way.\"", "The obvious question, then, is what makes those individual islands of scarcity more or less healthy than other communities? That's beyond the scope of the paper, but it's clear that the answer isn't simply that some places have fewer or worse doctors. \"The JAMA paper found that several measures of access to medical care had no clear relationship with longevity among the poor,\" noted the Times. \"But there were correlations with smoking, exercise, and obesity.\"", "The places where the poor lived the longest include New York and San Francisco—rich cities that can afford to provide a lot of services and have proactive public health departments. San Francisco was a pioneer in smoking bans; New York abolished trans fats. Poor people in and around Birmingham had a surprisingly high life expectancy, but there too there has been an investment in health services, according to the Times, and banned smoking in restaurants and other places in 2012.", "Any study like this comes with some caveats. One reason poor people in major metropolises have longer life expectancies could be that they have higher proportions of immigrants, who tend to live longer than native-born Americans. Some people have lower incomes because their poor health damaged their earnings power, not the other way round. And the authors adjusted the statistics for race and ethnicity in order to correct for racial differences in life expectancy (for instance, black people generally live less long than whites), something they've been criticized for. \"Social marginalization is not reducible to single variables,\" wrote Steven Woolf and Jason Purnell in a JAMA editorial. \"Race/ethnicity is inseparable from the economic consequences and stress associated with segregation, past and present marginalization in the distribution of resources, structural racism, persistent poverty, and violence.\"", "But if we accept the broader findings here, there seems to be almost a trickle-down affect when it comes to long life and health. In poverty-pocked areas in the Midwest and the South, poor people die sooner; in other words, in places that lack the services and infrastructure that wealthy big cities usually provide, people are less healthy.", "\"Health is about more than healthcare,\" Woolf and Purnell wrote. Good schools, crime-free neighborhoods, childhoods spared the trauma of family dysfunction, and other factors all contribute to whether someone is happy and healthy as an adult, or whether they're trapped in that old cycle of poverty begetting stress begetting illness begetting more poverty.", "Seen from this angle, inequality looks like not just a matter of unfair numbers but a public health problem. New York's example suggests at least the bones of a solution: higher taxes to fund a local government that develops policies to discourage people from eating crappy food and smoking. In many ways, this is a punishingly unfair city, but when it comes to having a healthy populace, it seems like other places could benefit from some New York values."], "targetTitle": "The One Strange Trick That Will Help You Live Longer: Have a Bunch of Money", "targetDescription": "A new study showed that the wealthy are living longer than the poor—but the size of that life expectancy gap varied wildly depending on where they lived.

That gives us purpose and motivation to strive forward. Yet, it can have detrimental consequences to our mental health, activating stress indicators that come as a byproduct of pushing ourselves too hard towards massive goals.", "As psychologist Karl Weick suggests in his article \"Small Wins,\" we should make it an everyday practice to focus our attention towards the positive by counting each small win we make. By taking the Alcoholics Anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective. Instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions:", "The impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety.", "By celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal.", "The Dangers of Dreaming Big", "We are encouraged on a daily basis to \"dream big\" and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things. This phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived.

If we forget to appreciate the small wins we regularly make, the following negative consequences will appear:", "Our sense of self-worth can be worsened", "We risk feeling bad about ourselves and feeling incompetent when we constantly compare present state to our final goals, which can only lessen our chances of making progress", "We are prone to the feeling of failure and depression when our goals can’t be achieved", "The increased amount of stress we have to cope with when we work on getting it all and now is counterproductive, as it blocks our productivity and weakens our physical health", "Once we change the perspective from big to small and break our final goal into smaller, achievable chunks, we take the pressure off and avoid the risks to our health. By focusing on everyday progress, we automatically feel much more motivated, which causes our brain to get hooked on the positive rush and the feeling of accomplishment striving to achieve more. Understanding the importance of small wins and knowing how to apply it to your everyday life will cause tremendous benefits to your goal achieving and your overall health.", "Here is the 4-step process you can take to develop the habit of celebrating small wins:", "Step 1: Start small", "First of all, you need to write down your final goal, and forget about it. It sounds silly, but this will help you focus on the fragments ahead of you, which is the only way to get things done. Instead of wasting energy on planning months ahead, focus on the next day’s challenges only. Be here and now and only think one step ahead in order to move forward. This will give you the constant sense of accomplishment, which will motivate you to move forward and boost your self-esteem.", "Step 2: Reflect often", "Every once in a while, take some time to reflect on your progress. So often we focus on goals yet to be accomplished and forget about the progress that has already taken place. This means comparing yourself — with yourself. For example, if your goal is to lose certain amount of weight, instead of beating yourself up for not getting there yet, you should compare some older photos of yourself to the new ones. By doing so, you will get the visual proof of your progress which serves as great inspiration for future advances and inspires positive emotions.", "Step 3: Reward yourself", "From early childhood, we get familiar with the achievement — reward formula which makes us consider it a norm in each such situation. Therefore, if you achieve certain success, no matter how big or small, your mind expects that you provide yourself with an adequate prize. If the reward doesn’t come, your motivational fuel gets drained, making your efforts futile. So, next time when you catch yourself single-mindedly chasing a complex goal without appreciating the small wins, give yourself a break and treat yourself to a movie, favorite sweet, or a short trip with your friends.", "Step 4: Enjoy the process", "Maybe the most important element to keep in mind in order to maintain mental strength in a competitive and goal-oriented world is to remind yourself to be content with yourself and the goals achieved. Remember to have fun and not take yourself too seriously. Enjoy experimenting and growing. By appreciating the process and the lessons learned, you will be able to avoid the stress and negative emotions, even if you don’t achieve the ultimate goal.", "ENDORSED BY Ricky Tang Editor", "Love this article?"], "targetTitle": "You Can Be Mentally Stronger If You Do This Small Act Every Day", "targetDescription": "Understanding the importance of small wins when you try to achieve your dreams will cause tremendous benefits to your overall mental health.", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/09/11000207/FotorCreated3-1024x576.jpg", "http://cdn-media-1.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/09/09040418/hands-night-festival-new-year-s-eve.jpg", "http://cdn-media-1.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/12/16060535/food-nature-autumn-nuts1-1024x682-170x170.jpg", "http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/12/15034951/Sleeping-Under-Blanket-with-Air-Conditioning11-170x170.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d96ed0ccffa38e39d5aea68fb54922f?s=80&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifehack.org%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Flifehack-theme%2Fimages%2Fdefault-avatar%2FA.png&r=g", "http://cdn-media-1.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/12/18055239/Changs-Taekwondo-Breathing-170x170.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d96ed0ccffa38e39d5aea68fb54922f?s=31&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifehack.org%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Flifehack-theme%2Fimages%2Fdefault-avatar%2FA.png&r=g", "http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2016/09/09040418/hands-night-festival-new-year-s-eve-1024x682.jpg", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7d20697b5cb6eaaa4fc4380694009a56?s=40&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifehack.org%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Flifehack-theme%2Fimages%2Fdefault-avatar%2FR.png&r=g"], "targetUrl": "http://www.lifehack.org/463850/you-can-be-mentally-stronger-if-you-do-this-small-act-every-day?ref=fbp&n=1", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Focus on the positives of each small win - an \"each day at a time\" mentality. #StopClickBait", "spoilerPublisher": "Stop Clickbait - Lifestyle"}, "spoiler": ["counting each small win we make"], "spoilerPositions": [[[1, 151], [1, 182]]], "tags": ["passage"]}

Both our iPhone and Android apps have had multiple releases, and we’re proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we’re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this live thread, and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.", "We’ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we’d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We’re still in the early days, but I’m happy we’re dedicating resources to it.", "As it relates to monetization, we’ve made a handful of changes: we tested adding affiliate tags to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off", "we announced Promoted User Posts", "and we announced tests we’ll be running on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don’t want to compromise what’s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.", "Yesterday, we previewed new moderator mail to moderators.

And he was right.", "Normally in humans, there are three separate barriers to stop a female from getting pregnant again if she is already pregnant.", "The first barrier is the hormonal changes after conception that stop the ovaries from releasing another egg.", "Dr Karl explores the uncommon phenomenon of superfetation.", "The second barrier is physical: a mucous plug. Almost immediately after conception, a plug forms in the cervix and sits at the top of the vagina. This plug stops any other sperm from entering the uterus and getting to a second egg.", "Third, there are physical and chemical changes that happen to the inner lining of the uterus in pregnancy. These changes usually stop a second fertilised egg from being able to attach to the uterine wall.", "Even so, some animal species manage to get around all these barriers. About 1 to 2 per cent of all pregnant cows show signs of being potentially fertile while they are already pregnant, and superfetation has been observed in animals such as the mouse, the rabbit, the sheep, the buffalo, the mink, and the Australian swamp wallaby.", "Superfetation is extremely uncommon in humans, with fewer than a dozen cases in the medical literature.", "A typical case is that of Julia Grovenburg, a 31-year-old woman from Arkansas.", "Ms Grovenburg and her partner had been trying to get pregnant for three years, and had begun to consider adoption of a child.", "But amazingly she conceived twice in 2009 — a few weeks apart.

But one was much larger and more developed than the other.", "As the ultrasounds scans mounted up for Ms Grovenburg, both foetuses seemed to be growing normally and healthily, though it appeared as if one foetus had simply started a few weeks after the other.", "In other words, Mrs Grovenburg had conceived a second baby a few weeks after becoming pregnant with the first.", "Now we don't have rock-solid proof that this is what happened. We would need a series of ultrasound scans to prove that.", "These scans would need to document a series of changes — starting with no foetus or amniotic sac in the uterus, and then a single foetus in its single amniotic sac, and a second foetus appearing in their own second amniotic sac after a few weeks.", "People don't usually get a series of ultrasound scans immediately after sexual intercourse, so this kind of hard data is difficult to get.", "But there is some evolutionary biology behind superfetation.

MAGA!,\" Susie Wiles, Trump’s Florida campaign manager, said in a text message using the acronym for his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. Her tone was a 180-degree turn from early in the evening when she called the day \"tense and nerve wracking.\"", "Despite Hillary Clinton’s large margins in Miami-Dade County and Broward County, Trump ran up the score elsewhere in the state -- from the Deep South Panhandle to the interior of Florida to peninsula’s southwest, a bastion of working-class whites and retirees from the Midwest who pushed him over the top. Trump ran up huge margins with white Florida voters -- who comprise 64 percent of the state’s voting rolls -- and have always been the most reliable voters in terms of turnout. Latino turnout in Miami-Dade and Orange County was just not enough for Clinton.", "The ups and downs of the campaign had gnawed at Wiles for weeks when she took over following a campaign shake-up that left her in charge of winning must-win Florida without much of a budget to advertise or turn out Republican voters who tend to disproportionately cast absentee ballots by mail.", "In early October, as Hurricane Matthew left part of the state damaged, Wiles realized the campaign had mistakenly not run an absentee ballot program at all. She sounded the alarm and Trump made sure the money was reprogrammed.", "Two weeks ago during a meeting at Trump’s golf club in Doral, sources said, Wiles successfully made the case to Trump to spend more on mail, advertising and paid callers to reach out to more Republican absentee ballot voters. Wiles, who managed Gov. Rick Scott’s first campaign, in 2010, would neither confirm nor deny the accounts.", "The spending was noteworthy because Trump, notoriously tight-fisted with campaign money, believed that campaigns dropped too much money on TV and get-out-the-vote \"ground game\" efforts. Instead, Trump had his outsized personality, his knowledge of Florida – his second home where he owns the Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago estate – and his plane that could carry him to any spot on a moment’s notice in Florida, where thousands of supporters materialized for his rallies seemingly spontaneously.", "But even with all of the new Trump spending, Hillary Clinton’s campaign began to surge. Black and Hispanic voters cast record numbers of absentee ballots and flocked to the early voting polls.", "By Tuesday morning, Democrats felt confident they could ride out the wave of what they knew would be a surge of Republican voters who tend to vote in greater force on Election Day.", "About 1 p.m., one source with Clinton’s campaign said, the Democrats were worried. Republicans were crushing the vote in the Panhandle, Southwest Florida and smaller conservative-leaning counties.", "\"By 5 p.m., our voters showed again,\" the source, not authorized to speak by the campaign, said. \"We felt pretty good.\"", "The size of the vote was historic in populous Democratic strongholds like Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties.", "But turnout was even higher in Republican areas. By the end of the night, Trump’s lead was so big that, even if turnout in Florida was modeled at 80 percent – far higher than recent elections – Clinton would still not win if she beat Trump by double digits.", "Clinton’s campaign was almost reduced to a regional effort confined to the southeastern peninsula. She won a stunning 571,000 more votes than Trump in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale media market, one of ten in the state, according to state elections data posted after midnight. She won three lesser markets: West Palm (a 44,000-vote lead); Gainesville (10,000 more votes) and Tallahassee (11,000 more votes).", "Trump blew away records in the Tampa Bay media market, the western edge of the vaunted I-4 corridor that helps swing elections. In the counties composing the market, Trump rolled up a 193,000 vote lead over Clinton. In the Jacksonville market in the northeast, he pulled in 165,000 more votes. He held vote leads of 144,000 in Naples-Fort Myers market, 126,000 in the Pensacola market, 83,000 in the Panama City market and 58,000 in the Orlando market, which anchors the eastern end of the I-4 corridor.", "One of Trump’s pollsters, Tony Fabrizio, said the results showed that Clinton exceeded President Obama’s margins in the Florida markets he won in 2012. But Obama only carried Florida by less than a point.", "\"The difference here is that Trump did far better than Mitt Romney did in almost every county on Election Day,\" Fabrizio said.", "Trump began Election Day down by at least 57,000 votes to Clinton, according to results posted on the Florida Division of Elections website just after the last Florida polls closed at 7 p.m. Central Time. But after that, as Election Day votes poured in, Trump began building a margin that stretched to more than 100,000 by 8:30 p.m.", "By 9:10 p.m., Trump’s margin started to peak at just under 150,000 votes over Clinton. It started to trend down. But not fast enough for the liking of Democrats, who just two hours before were musing about how Trump had lost Florida and therefore the White House.", "\"So goes Florida, so goes the country,\" said Florida’s senior senator, Bill Nelson. \"Look at the Hispanics turning out. Often the Hispanics are registered no party affiliation, but the young Hispanics, they’ll be voting for Hillary.\"", "Nelson and other Democrats also expected Clinton to pad her margin with African-American support.", "But while Clinton rolled up votes with non-white voters, white voters appeared to heavily trend toward Trump. And whites are still a majority of Florida’s voter rolls, 64 percent by registration. And they vote in even greater numbers. Their outsized support counteracted the votes of Hispanics and blacks – 16 percent and 13 percent of the voter rolls, respectively.", "Trump’s strong showing calls into question those who believed his inflammatory comments about immigration reform would ultimately cost him Florida. Trump’s positions put him at loggerheads with the Spanish-language powerhouse network, Univision, which has studios in the same city as his Doral golf club.", "\"My theory is that no one can make it to the WH without the Latino vote. It seems @realDonaldTrump has a different theory. See you Nov 8th,\" Univision pundit Jorge Ramos wrote June 3 on Twitter, repeating his oft-held maxim – proven wrong in this instance by Trump – about the power of the Hispanic vote.", "Florida is also a retiree mecca, with one of the oldest populations in the country. And poll after poll showed that the older the voter, the more they liked Trump.", "Most major surveys also showed Trump losing the state – including exit polls on Election Day.", "\"This was a data defying feat that captured a populist fervor we just couldn’t measure,\" said one Republican pollster who was surprised by Trump’s numbers. \"The Trump campaign kept talking about the missing white voter. Well, they showed up on Election Day.\"", "In myriad ways, Trump succeeded despite the conventional wisdom.", "Trump’s campaign initially didn’t run a robust absentee-ballot program to get voters to fill out and mail back their votes. He delayed advertising on television – a must for any other statewide candidate. And he refused at times to soften his tone on immigration.", "\"Trump didn’t run a robust program in South Florida targeting the Hispanic community. You could make an argument that his past statements [about immigration and illegal immigrants] made it impossible,\" said Curt Anderson, top adviser to Gov. Scott, the chair of the pro-Trump super PAC. \"But when Gov. Scott won, he did so because he really reached out. If Trump had, we wouldn’t be talking right now. He would have Florida in the bag. Maybe he’ll win because of what’s in the countryside, so to speak, or the Panhandle. But this is really doing it the hard way.\"", "The Florida meltdown is a familiar story for Democrats still scarred by Al Gore’s 2000 loss to George W. Bush in a razor close race. Though Obama won the state twice, both times were by narrow margins built on the strength of his appeal to minority voters in the state.", "But the vaunted Obama machine in Florida was no machine without Obama on the ticket. Now Democrats face a bleak prospect of the coming midterm elections, when liberal-leaning voters tend to stay away from the polls while Republicans keep voting. Sen. Nelson’s team fears a showdown with Scott, who has won twice based on the strength of white voters and an outsider message.", "Clinton allies expressed increasing optimism about their chances in the state heading into Election Day, energized by early vote results that showed Hispanic turnout exploding. Exit polls reinforced that optimism, showing Clinton with a narrow lead and demographic trends pointing her way.", "Trump’s strength was no surprise to Republican Party of Florida Chairman Blaise Ingoglia, who earlier in the day said Republicans had more energized voters who couldn’t wait until Election Day to cast ballots.", "\"We had the advantage in high-propensity voters and they didn’t,\" Ingoglia said. \"But ultimately, this is a message to the establishment.

Unlike acetaldehyde, acetate is innocuous and may even be responsible for some of the positive health benefits of alcohol consumption. Therefore the key to reducing alcohol-related damage lies in minimizing the amount of time acetaldehyde is present in the body.", "The Chinese researchers, therefore, decided that they would look at how the different beverages impacted the activity of ADH and ALDH.", "Some beverages were found to be terrible for a hangover. An herbal infusion with hemp seeds, for example, was discovered to boost the activity of ADH while inhibiting ALDH, therefore slowing down the breakdown of acetaldehyde and dragging out the hangover effects.", "On the other hand, some drinks, including Sprite (known in China as Xue bi) and a type of soda water, were found to have the opposite effect: increasing the activity of ALDH and thus speeding up the breakdown of acetaldehyde.", "The researchers are reportedly planning to conduct the tests in living organisms, but the results have already generated a lot of buzz, as people around the world celebrate the possible death of the hangover.

This was not bedroom playacting between lovers; Bensley claimed to be a centuries-old vampire who needed blood to stay alive. The woman escaped and called police, and Lyle the would-be vampire was arrested for assault.", "But is it safe to drink blood?", "In very small amounts (say, a few teaspoons), and if the blood is free from pathogens (such as the many blood-borne diseases), blood might not harm you. Beyond that, watch out. [Circulatory System: Facts, Function & Diseases]", "The strange fact is, blood, when drank, is toxic. When confined to places where blood is supposed to be — such as the heart, vessels, and so on — it is essential for life. But when ingested it's a very different story. Of course all toxins have doses, and just as a tiny bit of poison won't necessarily harm you, the more you eat or drink, the greater the danger. [7 Strange Ways that People Act Like Vampires]", "Because blood is so rich in iron — and because the body has difficulty excreting excess iron — any animal that consumes blood regularly runs a risk of iron overdose. While iron is necessary for all animals (and indeed most life), in high doses it can be toxic. This condition, called haemochromatosis, can cause a wide variety of diseases and problems, including liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders.", "Even so, blood-feeding in humans seems to be more common than one might expect. John Edgar Browning of Georgia Tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a BBC article that thousands of people across the United States drink blood for various reasons. Some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by Browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn't overdo the blood meals: \"No vampire I’ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood,\" Browning said, according to BBC.", "Unlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. According to Katherine Ramsland in her book \"The Science of Vampires\" (Penguin Putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, \"requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. When ingested, the blood goes through a tract that's adapted for extracting nutrients. Research on this system suggests that bats have a mucous membrane along the intestinal tract that acts as a barrier to prevent too much iron from getting into their bloodstreams.\"", "You, however, are not a vampire bat. Because humans did not evolve such an iron-extracting mechanism, drinking blood can kill us.", "If you're thinking of sampling human blood, make sure there's a doctor handy — for you, not your victim.", "Editor's Note: This article was first published on Sept. 2, 2011.", "Benjamin Radford is deputy editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine and author of six books including Scientific Paranormal Investigation: How to Solve Unexplained Mysteries.

At the time, Brooks had just been cleared of all charges stemming from the hacking fiasco that ended with more than 100 arrests and the closure of News of the World, which she oversaw.", "While Brooks emerged from the scandal without formal punishment, she had resigned from News International and spent several months on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. Her reputation in tatters, it was widely believed that her image and reputation had become too toxic to ever again hold a high position at News Corp.", "That speculation appears to have underestimated Murdoch's affinity for Brooks. Just eight months after being cleared of charges, Brooks is set to return to News Corp in a role focusing on digital media.", "Upward mobility", "Brooks enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of News Corp's tabloids to become one of the youngest top editors in Britain at the age of 32.", "Known as a sharp and aggressive journalist, Brooks was not afraid to test the limits of ethics when reporting stories. She once famously rigged a hotel room with recording devices when meeting a source who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Princess Diana.", "Another time, she dressed as a cleaning lady and hid in a bathroom stall in order to get an early copy of another London paper — The Sunday Times — and then stole one of the paper's scoops.", "Brooks's hard charging ways led her to some of the highest positions at Murdoch's tabloids. In 2000, she was named editor of News of the World. In 2003, she became the first female editor of The Sun.

Among the allegations was evidence that the voicemail of a murdered schoolgirl had been illegally accessed, which gave her family false hope that she was still alive.", "The inquiries dragged on for years, with Brooks eventually found not guilty of all charges.", "Brooks avoided jail time, but the damage had been done. The former editor had become the face of the out-of-contol excesses of London's tabloid media.", "Peter Jukes, a journalist who closely followed the hacking trial, noted that Brooks' reputation has not recovered despite her acquittal on all charges.", "\"I can say that having toured around the UK talking about the trial ... the overwhelming question isn't, 'Why was Rebekah put on trial,' but 'Why was she found not guilty?'\" Jukes said.", "But it was Brooks' bond with Murdoch that served her even after ending up as the type of tabloid fodder that she had once fed on. As the chairman and CEO of News Corp, Murdoch has been one of the most powerful global media figures for decades. His affinity for her had been the source of no shortage of reporting in the UK, with some saying that she was like a daughter to him.", "An odd fit", "Even if some people believed that Brooks would eventually return to a role at News Corp, few expected her to land at Storyful.

Founded by journalist Mark Little, the company sought to tap the emergence of citizen journalism on social media, particularly the posting of pictures and video. The company worked to find and verify this kind of content. This aggregated media would then be provided to its media partners.", "The startup was quickly seen as being on the cutting edge of digital journalism, particularly the use of social media and crowdsourcing to provide almost real-time coverage of breaking news. The company accrued an impressive list of clients, including the BBC, ABC and The New York Times, which use content found and vetted by Storyful. (Mashable is also a Storyful client.)", "News Corp bought Storyful in December 2013 for $25 million, pledging that the startup would operate as a standalone company.", "Storyful had been built in part on a promise of veracity and accountability in a space that had been lacking credibility.", "Now, with Brooks entering the fold, that promise has begun to ring hollow.", "I feel so sorry for the people I know at @Storyful if this is true. http://t.co/eUpjZu5hVw They deserve better. — Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) March 2, 2015", "Wait, what?

There was a primary school for the prisoners' children, who they brought to live with them, and in the most notorious twist of all, there was an in-house cocaine factory.", "\"I thought what is this place?

The rights were acquired by Brad Pitt's production company but have since expired.

Given two unpopular candidates, it’s possible that \"popularity\" just won’t matter as much, that voters will take both candidates’ worst qualities as a given and move on. In which case, both Clinton and Trump become generic nominees. And what are the prospects this year for a generic Republican nominee? Of five separate econometric models of the election, four predict a Republican win ranging from 50.9 percent of the vote to 55 percent of the two-party vote. The economy is middling, President Obama well-liked but not hugely popular, and Clinton would be a third term for Democrats. Given two generic candidates under those criteria, the presidency would go to the Republican. Say hello to President Trump.", "Let’s say you don’t trust the models (they couldn’t predict Trump, after all). Then what? How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? The answer is easy: He wins and turns out white voters in historic numbers. Assume higher nonwhite support for the Democrat—let’s say a three-point bump among blacks and a seven-point bump among Hispanics, giving Clinton 97 percent and 80 percent support, respectively—and Trump needs 66 percent of whites to win both the popular and electoral-college vote, if turnout doesn’t change. (You can play with the numbers over at RealClearPolitics.)", "How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? He turns out white voters in historic numbers.", "It’s an extraordinary reach: an increase of nearly six points over the white share in 2012, matching Ronald Reagan’s performance in 1984. It would mean Trump persuaded millions of Democrats to switch teams, despite their wide approval for President Obama.", "In other words, it’s not happening. Partisanship has a tight hold on American voting behavior, and it’s hard to imagine how Trump could break it, barring a national catastrophe. Easier to imagine is higher white turnout. If Trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to its 2008 levels—74 percent—then he could win with another couple percentage points among whites, even with the high black and Latino turnout of 2008. This would give him teetering Democratic states such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as the three largest swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. It’s a heavy lift, especially for a candidate who says he will eschew data-gathering and other quantitative methods for finding and mobilizing supporters. But it’s possible.", "OK, OK. \"Possible\" doesn’t mean \"likely,\" and it’s hard to imagine a disorganized campaign exceeding Team Romney’s ability to pinpoint and bring Republican-leaning white voters to the polls. Still, with a smile from Fortuna (or whichever god of chance you prefer), Trump can win. If anything guarantees defeat for an incumbent party, it’s a recession. At the opening of the 1960 election, in early spring of that year, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were neck and neck. This continued into the summer and the early fall. But by October, Kennedy had opened a small but persistent lead. He won.", "It’s hard to isolate a single cause for Kennedy’s victory, but he was almost certainly helped along by the modest recession that struck in the spring and lasted until the following winter. If not for that downturn, there’s a fair chance Nixon would have become president. A sudden slowdown could have the same effect on our election. In fact, the very presence of Trump—his proximity to the most powerful office in the world—could destabilize markets and make a downturn more likely. And consider this: On average, the United States sees a recession every five years. We’re due. One is all we need for President Trump.", "A terrorist attack could do it—driving voters into the arms of the authoritarian in the race—but the literature is mixed on how terrorism affects voters. It could make them more attuned to perceived outsiders—and immigrants in particular—giving Trump an advantage. It could push them toward hawkish candidates with traditional credentials, helping Clinton. Or given the candidates, it could be a wash. So let’s table this one.", "There’s one last thing that could deliver the White House to Trump: a divided Democratic Party. Party unity is a prerequisite for national competition. It’s why the \"Never Trump\" movement fell apart after Ted Cruz left the race; a serious effort to derail the Republican nominee would guarantee a Democratic White House, because it’s almost impossible to overcome the asymmetry. In the still unlikely event that the present acrimony between Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party becomes an outright split, Democrats risk throwing the election to Trump, through in-fighting and division. If Sanders runs as a third-party candidate, the game is over, and Democrats lose. You see this in the most recent polling. Clinton’s biggest weakness in the NBC News survey of registered voters is with Sanders’ backers who haven’t crossed the threshold to Team Clinton. If this persists, it’s dangerous. If history is any indication, however, it won’t be.", "With all this said, even the most probable scenario here—that Trump and Clinton become generic candidates—is a distant long shot. They’re just too well-known for voters to treat them as interchangeable with any Republican or any Democrat. And their personal qualities mix with the fundamentals of this election—partisanship, demographics, and economic performance—to create favorable terrain for Democrats."], "targetTitle": "It’s a Long Shot, but Here’s How Trump Could Win", "targetDescription": "At this moment, polls show a strong upswing for Donald Trump’s campaign.

So does Ben’s HBO appearance mean he still hopes they can reconcile? Does he still believe he can get Jen to come around and change her mind and not finally file divorce papers?", "According to an exclusive ET Online report, a source quotes that they are making it work.

They both live on their property in Brentwood California. Another source told ET: \"They’re in a good place and co-parenting the best they can.\"", "Confused? ET did it’s best to get to the bottom of this conundrum. Do Ben and Jen know what they’re intensions are? Do they share every relationship up and down with the press and let the tabloids write what they will? Or, do the pair have things worked out and simply tell the press what it wants to hear in order to keep their lives private and press distracted?", "Radar Online has an interview with Jennifer’s father after the devastating floods that hit West Virginia.

One friend of Jennifer’s says: \"nothing has changed\" in the relationship: \"They’re still all about putting the kids first.\"", "Yet another report states that Ben doesn’t want a divorce and Jen has denied to friends that they’ve reconciled. The friend also said that Jen doesn’t mind that the divorce hasn’t been finalized, but she still intends on going through with it.", "And to pile on more confusion, the same friend said that Jen really enjoyed her time with Ben and their kids in Europe. She liked spending time with Ben again. And yet another source said: \"They have a lot of admiration and respect for each other\"", "So which is it? Will they or won’t they divorce? Will Ben Affleck and Jen Garner continue to play this game with the press, teasing the tabloids while not really giving them an answer? Or is Jen dangling the reconciliation worm before ben and is ben the one who’s being jerked about?", "What do you think is going on, CDL readers? Tell us in the comments.

The little girl had been a victim to so much force that she bit through her own tongue. While it’s unknown where her father or other family members were at the time, it seems as if the violent Kathryn Smith was unstoppable when inflicting trauma on her innocent child.", "Neighbors of Smith later said that they hear the girl’s voice shouting \"Stop Mummy, Stop Daddy!\" But it was too late by the time she made it to the hospital. Ayeeshia died days later.", "In a situation like this, prison alone isn’t enough punishment. And Smith’s fellow prisoner’s didn’t take what the murderer did lightly. Two inmates took justice into their own hands and brutally attacked the woman in a stairwell that was absent of video surveillance.

In the last seven years in which the S&P 500 rose in each of the first three quarters, only in one of them — 2007 — did the index drop in the fourth.", "Actually, when one looks at the entire performance history of the S&P 500 going back to 1928 (which is available despite the fact that the index was technically created in 1957) one finds that out of the 19 years in which the market rose in the first, second and third quarters, a negative fourth quarter only followed five times.

However, it is also the case that the fourth quarter just happens to be better for investors in general; the market rose in 73 percent of fourth quarters, and actually turned out a better median performance of a 4.5 percent gain.", "The recent rises seen in fourth quarters can thus be ascribed to market seasonality — or, perhaps more credibly, to mere randomness.", "But for the bullish strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat, who has pointed to similar figures in the past, something more is at work. Lee argues that in years when stocks are doing well, active managers will invest heavily in an attempt to avoid lagging the market too badly — creating an additional bullish force in the market. The fact that 2016 has been a good year so far is therefore a reason to bet that stocks will rise, he concludes.", "So will the fourth quarter, which begins on Monday, continue the bullish trend?",
