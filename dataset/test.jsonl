And though we ranked an abysmal 67th when it came to closing the wage gap, overall the U.S. ranked 6th for economic participation. But the U.S. has a serious gender issue when it comes to politics, receiving a score of .159 for overall political empowerment, mostly because we have so few women in legislative and ministerial positions. For example, women make up just 18.3 percent of the 113th Congress.", "And of course, this report does not account for everything that makes up the quality of a woman's life.

It simply couldn't make enough toys to satiate demand in North America, and needed a break while it boosted capacity at its factories and increased its workforce by nearly a quarter.", "\"We feel we need to invest, to build some breathing space,\" Lego's finance chief John Goodwin explained.", "Lego, a family-owned company founded in Denmark in 1932, has enjoyed booming growth for decades. The company has released thousands of sets of its eponymous blocks, forging licensing deals with popular brands including Star Wars, Angry Birds and Disney Princesses. It has also taken on iconic architecture: A 2989-piece model of the Sydney Opera house is for sale on Lego's website for $399.99, while a 561-piece White House set sells for $89.99. A replica of the Ghostbusters firehouse, meanwhile, is listed for $499.99.", "And the company's dominance has extended into the company's seven Legoland theme parks, 125 retail stores and dozens of video games. The Lego Movie, a full-length movie released in 2014, brought in $US468.2 million ($610.4 million) at the box office.", "The company's revenue has increased by an average of 15 per cent a year in the past 12 years, according to Reuters.", "The efforts to quell demand seem to have worked - at least temporarily. Sales in the Americas remained flat during the first half of 2016, according to the news agency. (Revenue in Asia and Europe, meanwhile, continued to grow by double digits.)

That's the promise of virtual reality (VR) headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.", "As impressive as the technology already is, many believe it's still in its early days. That's because previous virtual reality-style efforts have flopped in the past. (Nintendo's Virtual Boy comes to mind.) But the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more.", "Few have watched virtual reality evolve as closely as the companies building the hardware that powers it. TIME sat down with Frank Azor, general manager of the Dell-owned gaming PC manufacturer Alienware, and Nelson Gonzalez, Alienware's cofounder and former CEO, to discuss what they have learned about VR and where they believe it's headed. Below are the key highlights from our conversation.", "Virtual reality will get more physical", "Anyone who's seen or tried the HTC Vive knows that some physical activity is involved. The Vive and its two controllers are equipped with sensors that allow players to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush.", "But what systems like the Vive or PlayStation VR currently lack is a sense of touch. Although it may look like you're swinging a golf club, the device in your hand still feels like a video game controller. (The Oculus Rift doesn't yet support any motion controllers, although the company plans to launch such devices later in 2016.) This is going to be one of the first areas in which virtual reality will improve, says Gonzalez.", "\"The next evolution of VR would be where you participate physically in that VR world,\" Gonzalez said. \"And not just sitting down; if you're a quarterback, you actually get to throw a football, and you can interface with the team. So that kind of stuff, it's there, it's going to happen.\"", "Incorporating better touch controls will only be the start. Azor believes future VR devices could refine concepts first introduced as far back as 1962 with the Sensorama , which incorporated elements like wind and smells.", "\"Headsets today are doing an excellent job at catering to your visual senses, and a little bit of audio as well,\" said Azor, also Alienware's fourth employee. \"Well that's just two of the senses . . . Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual piece begins to fade.\"", "It's unclear exactly how — and if — technologies like those Azor described will ever take shape. But some companies are certainly trying. Leap Motion, a startup which launched a motion-sensing camera for computers in 2013, is now building technology for interacting with VR environments without a controller. Startup Thalmic Labs also makes an armband capable of controlling electronic devices through gestures that works with the Rift.", "VR is an industry-wide effort", "The Oculus Rift will likely be remembered as the first modern virtual reality headset. But it takes more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way, says Azor.", "Azor draws comparisons to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade. PCs became better equipped to deliver high-end gaming experiences as companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia developed more powerful chips and graphics processors.

Ortuzar, who was then one of the chefs at Craft, \"was known for doing these great sandwiches after work and said hey, let’s do a sandwich restaurant. And that’s how 'Wichcraft was born,\" Colicchio told The Feast. Over the years, that little sandwich shop has grown into a ubiquitous chain—which just opened its ninth branch and is opening its tenth in Grand Central this fall—thanks to Colicchio and Ortuzar's knack for creating some of the most thrilling ingredient-driven sandwiches, soups and lunch offerings in NYC.", "Tom Colicchio (right) with Sisha Ortuzar.", "Still, as Colicchio himself admits, sometimes those lunch orders could take a little longer to prepare than a rushed and hungry customer might like. Now, with its brand-new location in Tribeca, Colicchio says the reconceived kitchen set-up will let the orders come out \"much faster.\" Its sandwiches, like the phenomenal BLT, will take an average of \"five minutes as opposed to 12-13 minutes,\" Colicchio said. The tweaking and rebranding of 'Wichcraft will soon spread to all shops in the chain, and Colicchio said he's hoping to expand 'Wichcraft to other cities in the near future.

Otherwise don’t make it.\"", "'Wichcraft BLT; Photo credit: Peden + Munk.", "If you're like us, you'll be whipping up this sandwich multiple times a week, all the way through tomato season. In New York, that's typically August until early September, and that's the only time you'll find this BLT on 'Wichcraft's menu.

You can order it in multiple editions (including an audiobook recorded by Matt and me) at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, iBooks, Google Play, Kobo, or your favorite indie bookseller.", "We're very proud of the book, and can't wait for people to start reading, but if you still need a taste or two to push you over the buying edge, The Ringer ran an excerpt last week featuring part of our explanation for how the top 100 was chosen, along with our joint essay on Deadwood, while Matt's home base at Vulture this morning has the essay on our top-ranked show, The Simpsons(*).", "(*) Maybe my favorite section of the book – and the favorite of many of the early reviewers – is called The Great Debate, where Matt and I argue out what should get the top pick after we initially wound up with a five-way tie for first place.", "Included below is the essay I wrote about a little show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which finished in a tie for 25th place – alongside, appropriately enough, fellow classic high school dramas Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life – among our Pantheon of series, coming up just as soon as I get the mustard out...", "Buffy the Vampire Slayer (WB, 1997–2001; UPN, 2001–2003) Total score: 94", "TV show titles rarely bring viewers into the tent, but they can keep them out. If you want to give your charming blended-family comedy an ironic name like Trophy Wife, don\"t be surprised if your target demographic takes it literally and stays far away. (See also Terriers, Selfie, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...)", "Now, Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran seven seasons, was never in danger of cancellation at any point (it jumped networks after season 5 only because UPN was looking to steal a hit from its rival the WB), launched a long-running (and, eventually, very good) spin-off in Angel, was beloved by its fans, and helped define the identity of an entire TV network for the short but memorable existence of the WB. By any standard you want to measure, Buffy was a success.", "Except maybe this one: If you tell someone who\"s never watched it that a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer is among the best TV dramas of all time, they will roll their eyes at you and change the subject to something less divisive, like immigration policy.", "Would a Buffy the Vampire Slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic, or won more awards, or simply have been an easier sell to non-fans? Certainly, you can imagine WB executives thinking that, which is why they briefly tried to get Joss Whedon to shorten the title to just Slayer.", "Whedon held firm, and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world songs like \"Reign in Blood\" and \"Mandatory Suicide.\" He knew that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the perfect title for his series, because it captured the exact spirit of what he was planning to make.", "You could give it a more serious or distinguished title, but no matter the packaging, the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who discovered that her destiny was to protect humankind from vampires, demons, and other creatures of the underworld, and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy. The name tells you all of that, and suggests that if you\"re turned off by it, you\"re probably not going to like the series to which it\"s applied.", "It was a tonal balance that director Fran Rubel Kuzui didn\"t even bother attempting with the campy Buffy movie adapted from Whedon\"s first script. The show, though, would have room for many different emotions, all juggled expertly by Gellar, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan, and the rest of the cast. It was a series made cheaply even by the standards of TV\"s fifth-place network, but it almost never seemed ridiculous despite the primitive effects and awkward stunt-doubling for Gellar. If it wanted to make you laugh at a bit of witty banter (\"I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.\"), it could. If it wanted its latest monster to creep you out, it found the most disturbing context possible. And if it wanted to make you cry, it was pointless to try fighting it.", "If anything, the exaggerated nature of the various undead villains only made the high school setting more effective, because what is adolescence if not a time when every problem gets blown wildly out of proportion?", "In the real world, a girl whose boyfriend started treating her badly after they finally have sex wouldn\"t need to worry that he had turned pure evil, as happened with Buffy and her vampire love interest Angel (David Boreanaz), but it might feel that way for a while. And a real teen boy going through the changes of puberty might occasionally imagine himself a monster, but laconic guitar player Oz (Seth Green) actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon was full.", "Turning monsters into metaphors for teenage emotional turmoil was a clever gambit, and one that played particularly well during the show\"s three seasons set in high school. Buffy is (by our rankings, anyway) one of the best TV shows ever set in high school, but it wasn\"t entirely immune to the same problems that eventually beset all such shows when their characters head to college. Even so, those later seasons still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal, like Buffy\"s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) literally being put on earth to cause her problems (which in this case involved the literal end of the world).", "(Those later years also offered some thrilling formal experiments, including \"Hush,\" an homage to silent horror movies, involving demons who rob people of the ability to speak or scream; \"The Body,\" a stripped-down outing where Buffy confronts the mundane reality of her mother\"s death from natural causes; and the musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling,\" where a curse forces everyone to express their feelings through song.)", "Back to that title. Whedon once suggested to the New York Times, \"If I made Buffy the Lesbian Separatist, a series of lectures on PBS on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring. The idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium.\"", "Whedon didn\"t invent feminism in TV storytelling, or even the idea of cross-pollinating it with fantasy and sci-fi tropes. (For much of its run, Buffy overlapped with Xena: Warrior Princess.) But he created one of the finest examples of it, and wrapped it up in a wildly entertaining package that included a name that may have made some potential viewers roll their eyes, but that made enough of them smile and think this might just be a show for them.", "And it was."], "targetTitle": "TV (THE BOOK): Why ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’ was one of TV’s best shows ever", "targetDescription": "In an excerpt from TV (THE BOOK), Alan Sepinwall writes about the greatness of Joss Whedon's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" starring Sarah Michelle Gellar.", "targetKeywords": "sepinwall, buffy the vampire slayer, tv the book", "targetMedia": ["http://p.uproxxcdn.com/photo/106987/profile", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=722969591073270&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bmw-feat-uproxx-1.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l68nb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/hitfixharleyteasuicidesquad.jpgwp-content/uploads/2016/08/tv-the-book-buffy.jpg?quality=100&w=650&h=433", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/150964.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "http://dbg52463.moatads.com?a=5a7216d001e44d7f8e401aa5705d27f8", "http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l68nb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ryan-murphy.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/nodapl-wells-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8430760&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/top-chef-feat-uproxx-2.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/weird-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/fastlane-header.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "http://p.uproxxcdn.com/content/default-avatar.jpg", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/tv-the-book-buffy.jpg?quality=100&w=650", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/starter-jacket-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73t-O7FWprUTo.gif", "http://d5i9o0tpq9sa1.cloudfront.net?a=5a7216d001e44d7f8e401aa5705d27f8", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/jeff-sessions-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/alan-sepinwall.jpg?quality=100&w=48", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/carl-ichan-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/future-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/grohlsteen-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/sharp-dressed-man-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/spice-girls-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ice-ramp-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/chef-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/netflix-theater-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/kevin-gates-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/sampha-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1"], "targetUrl": "http://m.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/tv-the-book-why-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-was-the-best-possible-name-for-that-show", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "because it was.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy.

Wells Fargo data show that of those who are saving, half are putting away 6% of their income or more.", "What we're not so hot at, according to many of these same surveys, is investing. Many of us are frightened or confused by the topic and even inclined to put our money in a sock and call it a day. That's a problem, because investing the money you save is nearly as important as saving it in the first place.", "Here are five crucial moves Millennials can make to overcome their investing anxieties.", "1. Get an education", "At least this one will be free. Investing is understandably scary. Until you learn what you're doing, it feels an awful lot like gambling in Vegas without the free drinks.", "There are plenty of resources to guide you through the basics; you just have to put in the time. Khan Academy is a good place to start, as is NerdWallet's guide on how to invest in stocks. Morningstar has a good, if slightly dated, investing classroom, and online brokers often have a ton of beginner-focused educational materials on their websites.", "2. Say hello to risk", "Risk is kind of like that friend who regularly cancels plans but always comes through in a pinch. There might be heartache in the day-to-day, but in the long run, you'll be glad you stuck it out.", "In investing, more risk means the potential for more reward. Investments that require you to take on risk, like stocks, have to offer you a premium for doing so. Could you lose money and never collect that premium? Sure, but that's unlikely when you're in it for the long-term. ", "History illustrates this: A portfolio of 100% stocks had an average annual return of 10.1% between 1926 and 2015, according to a study by Vanguard. A portfolio of 100% bonds returned roughly half that, averaging 5.4%. To put that into real-money terms, if you invested $5,000 for 50 years at a 10.1% return, you'd have $614,000. At a 5.4% return, you'd have just $69,000.", "But a 2015 study from BlackRock found that Millennials might have as much as 70% of their money in cash, meaning a savings account, a pillowcase, old sneakers. At today's historically low interest rates, it's all roughly the same. That $5,000 becomes just $8,000 at a 1% return; in your shoe, it stays $5,000. Factor in inflation   a force that Millennials may soon notice for the first time in their adult lives   and you're actually losing money.", "3. Take that risk through index funds", "About 70% would be a reasonable stock allocation for your retirement portfolio   and even that might be on the low side. At this age, you should have most of your long-term savings invested in stocks. The best way to do that is not by dumping your money into Apple stock, but with low-cost index and exchange-traded funds.", "Those funds pool investor money to buy many different investments in one swoop. You can buy a couple of funds that hold the stock of U.S. companies, one that holds international companies and one that holds emerging-markets companies and you'll be reasonably diversified.", "You can learn more about building a diversified portfolio in NerdWallet's piece on investing in your 20s.", "4. Put a lid on fees", "You can't control the ups and downs of the stock market. What you can mostly control are investing costs   fees charged by your index funds (called expense ratios), administrative fees in your 401(k) and transaction fees incurred when you buy and sell investments.", "Every dollar that goes to these costs is a dollar that reduces your returns. Keep transaction costs down by limiting unnecessary trading and using commission-free and no-transaction-fee funds. Most brokers will have a list of both types of funds. If an index fund's expense ratio is more than 0.25%, you can likely do better with another.", "5. Use a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k)", "Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA are made with pre-tax dollars; you pay taxes when you take distributions in retirement. But you can also pay taxes now and spare your future self the burden by choosing a Roth IRA (check Roth contribution limits to gauge your eligibility) or the Roth version of your 401(k), if your employer offers that option.", "Why choose a Roth? If your income is lower now than it will be later   a likely scenario for many young professionals   you're locking in at lower tax rate. And because you're not getting a tax benefit now, you get to pull out the money   both your contributions and investment growth   tax free in retirement.

Alexandre Mas, an economist at Princeton, studied the effects of a 2010 California law that required cities to publish municipal salaries. It prompted pay cuts, but only among men.", "Women might have been spurred to negotiate after seeing that their salaries were lower, he theorized, or cities might have made salaries more equitable to avoid lawsuits.", "A few European countries have required that big companies publish pay information by sex.

In other research, she found that when women did ask, they asked for 30 percent less than men requested.", "Because starting salaries determine raises and future salaries, women who do not bargain lose as much as $750,000 for middle-income jobs and $2 million for high-income jobs over their careers, Ms. Babcock found.", "But her research and that of others has found that women are penalized for negotiating, while men are rewarded for the same behavior.

Another is to change corporate practices so the people who set compensation are aware of the disparity and are advocates for women during negotiations.", "Another answer is to ban pay negotiation completely. That is what Ellen Pao did when she was chief executive of Reddit. The company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers.", "\"We put the onus on the company to pay fairly instead of on candidates to negotiate fair pay,\" Ms. Pao wrote in The Hollywood Reporter.", "Don’t Rely on Previous Salaries", "If women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low, one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries.", "Google has said it does this and instead makes offers based on what a job is worth.", "In August, the federal Office of Personnel Management said government hiring managers could no longer rely on an employee’s previous salary when setting his or her new one.

Oh yeah, and the headphone jack ? It's dead.

In short, you could likely replicate the experiment with any other vegetable. (Animal behavior specialists also have other theories, including that the cats might think the cucumber is a deadly snake or other predator.)", "However, National Geographic reports that your cat’s fright is more harmful than hilarious. While the cucumber isn’t stressful to you, it’s stressful to the cat. And since your pet usually has positive associations with the space surrounding its food bowl, you’re startling it while it’s in its comfort zone. In worst case scenarios, it can react by hurting itself, breaking a household object, or remaining anxious for days.", "Bottom line?

In May, the Oxford University Press also published a Roald Dahl Dictionary complete with 8,000 words coined or popularized by the author.", "There was linguistic method to Dahl’s mad use of language. \"He was using very linguistic principles,\" says Vineeta Gupta, head of children’s dictionaries at Oxford University Press. Dahl invented words based on old words, rhymes, malapropisms, and spoonerisms (swapping the first letters of words around, such as \"catasterous disastrophe\" from The BFG). Dahl also played with sound (\"sizzle-pan\" to refer to a frying pan in The BFG, for example).", "Here are the new Dahlisms added to the OED, and the revised phrases, with notes on their origins.", "New entries", "Dahlesque The characteristics of Dahl’s work—in the OED’s words, \"eccentric plots, villainous or loathsome adult characters, and gruesome or black humour\"—now have their own adjective. The term was first used in 1983 by the literary magazine Books Ireland.", "Golden ticket These refer to the tickets hidden in chocolate bars that granted access to Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964). The first golden ticket, however, was awarded to 18th century painter William Hogarth, giving him admission to the Vauxhall Gardens in London, in recognition of his paintings of the venue.", "Human bean This is a mispronunciation of \"human being,\" uttered by the giant in The BFG (1982): \"We is having an interesting babblement about the taste of the human bean. The human bean is not a vegetable.\" The first instance of the phrase is over a century older, having been used in an issue of the British satirical magazine Punch in 1842.", "Oompa Loompa The diminutive factory workers who played music and danced in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory were made more famous by the 1971 film adaption of the book, starring Gene Wilder. Gupta called the phrase \"typical Dahlesque,\" reflecting how the author played with sound to convey meaning.", "Scrumdiddlyumptious \"Extremely scrumptious", "excellent, splendid", "(esp. of food) delicious.\" Although the word was first found in The American Thesaurus of Slang in 1942, Dahl’s giant’s use of it planted it firmly in the minds of every child who read The BFG: \"Every human bean is diddly and different. Some is scrumdiddlyumptious and some is uckyslush.\"", "Witching hour Referred to in The BFG as \"a special moment in the middle of the night when every child and every grown-up was in a deep deep sleep, and all the dark things came out from hiding and had the world to themselves.\" We can thank Shakespeare for this evocative phrase: according to the OED, \"witching time\" first appeared in Hamlet (1604)."], "targetTitle": "Scrumdiddlyumptious to Oompa Loompa: Six of Roald Dahl’s splendiferous words have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary", "targetDescription": "Roald Dahl is remembered for his solitary, kind-hearted child heroes—Charlie, who visited a chocolate factory, and Sophie, who befriended a floppy-eared giant, among them—and their triumphs over bullying adults.

He was also a heroin addict.", "Never even a recreational drug user, Andrew had been the first to discourage friends at his Catholic high school from smoking pot. But his story is frighteningly typical of the current heroin epidemic among suburban American youth. It's an issue made all the more timely by the recent heroin-related death of Glee star Cory Monteith, best known and beloved for playing squeaky-clean high school football star Finn Hudson.", "What Cory and Andrew expose is that heroin isn't at all what it used to be. Not only is the drug much more powerful than before (purity can be as high as 90 percent) but it's also no longer limited to the dirty-needle, back-alley experience so many of us picture. Now it's as easy as purchasing a pill, because that's what heroin has become: a powder-filled capsule known as a button, designed to be broken open and snorted, that can be purchased for just $10. And it regularly is—on varsity sports teams, on Ivy League campuses, and in safe suburban neighborhoods.", "During his sophomore year of college, Andrew fell ill from a virus that left him with pancreas damage. Soon after that, he broke his hand. Add in routine wisdom teeth surgery, and Andrew was swimming in prescription painkillers. He became addicted. \"He would steal them, he would buy them, he would find them wherever he could,\" remembers his friend, 26-year-old Missouri native Katie Gerstenkorn. \"He stole painkillers from me, actually.\"", "When Andrew was given a capsule of heroin at a party, he was instantly hooked. According to Dan Duncan, associate executive director at St. Louis's National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (NCADA), most heroin users start with pain pills as Andrew did. It's no wonder: In an interview with 60 Minutes last year, National Institute on Drug Abuse director Dr. Nora Volkow dropped the eye-opening statistic that in a country of 312 million people, 210 million prescriptions for opiate medications were written in 2011 alone. But pain pills are expensive—legally and on the black market—pushing those dependent on them to seek out a cheaper, more easily accessible alternative with a similar kind of high: heroin.", "Andrew went to his parents for help. \"He couldn't get away from the drug,\" says his mom, Pam. \"It's a hunger, it's a thirst. You throw all your morals out the window.\" Before long, he was caught stealing money from his roommates so he could buy more. After a stint in rehab, an overdose, and another stint in rehab, it looked like he was finally starting to get a handle on his addiction. Like Cory Monteith, Andrew was doing his best to clean up—and everyone in his life believed he could do it. Until the overdose that killed him.", "In 2008 Duncan and his NCADA staff started getting an influx of calls about heroin to their help line. \"It wasn't just that we were getting calls about heroin—we were getting calls about heroin and teens specifically,\" he says. \"It became clear that this was a problem in some of the best high schools in the area. Public, private, most of them.\" By 2010, the year Andrew died, the number of calls about heroin had exploded. \"The thing that was most startling was the average age of the deaths from heroin overdoses,\" says St. Louis County police chief Tim Fitch. \"Historically the age for most heroin deaths has been in the 40-to-45 range. But now the average age is between eighteen and 25.\"", "For some, heroin abuse starts even earlier. At fourteen, Emily* was a high school freshman who had just made the varsity cheerleading squad. By fifteen, she was a regular heroin user. Despite her habit, Emily was able to maintain a facade at school, getting good grades and staying out of trouble. \"It was like I was leading a double life,\" she says. \"I thought, Maybe this is my little secret, and it's not as bad as everyone says it is.\"", "At first, she did it only on weekends with a friend of a friend's older brother. He would provide the drug for free but quickly began pressuring her to have sex with him. Eventually she caved. \"I slept with him because I felt like he was giving something to me, so I had to give something to him,\" she admits. \"Looking back on it, my self-esteem was so low, and that's why I was doing all these things.\" Her supplier was 30 years old.", "Emily started skipping school, and then didn't try out for cheerleading the next year. Doing heroin became part of her daily routine. When a friend wanted to try it for her sixteenth birthday, Emily realized heroin wasn't her little secret anymore—it was something other kids at her school were doing too.", "Over the course of two years, she entered treatment six times, overdosed on heroin twice, and ran away from home. Emily was thrown out of a hotel and a homeless shelter after that. She returned home and attended twelve-step meetings, but continued to use. Finally a switch flipped. \"I was willing to go to any length to get high, and then it became clear that I needed to go to any length to get sober. I had to change every single thing in my life, which was terrifying,\" Emily says. \"But when the pain of staying the same was greater than the pain of change, that's when I knew I really had to do something.\"", "In 2012 and 2013, local news reports in Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Orange County, Syracuse, and a growing number of other areas told the tales of teens dying from heroin. Cases like Andrew's are becoming more of the norm, while those of recovering addicts like Emily seem to be more of the exception. And with a year and a half of sobriety under her belt, Emily wants to expose teens to the scary prevalence of the drug that nearly killed her. She speaks at schools and treatment centers and is studying to become a nurse. \"Today I can be a part of things instead of apart from them. It's so hard to describe the pain and the misery I felt, the downward spiral,\" Emily says. \"My worst day in sobriety is so much better than even my best day getting high.\"", "*Name has been changed."], "targetTitle": "Heroin Hits Home: The Deadly Drug Invades America's Schools", "targetDescription": "By Julia Rubin\r\n\r\n\"What have I become?\" 23-year-old Andrew Jones asked his mom shortly before he died. \"What's happened to me?\" A star h...", "targetKeywords": "Heroin Addiction,teen drug addition,teen drug abuse,high school news,teen news,drug prevention,heroin in high schools", "targetMedia": ["http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1345868/images/n-SCHOOL-HALLWAY-628x314.jpg", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1345868/images/o-SCHOOL-HALLWAY-facebook.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "targetUrl": "http://huff.to/18pcgue", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Heroin; yes it is says @Teenvogue", "spoilerPublisher": "HuffPoSpoilers"}, "spoiler": ["heroin", "local news reports in Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Orange County, Syracuse, and a growing number of other areas told the tales of teens dying from heroin"], "spoilerPositions": [[[1, 311], [1, 317]], [[12, 18], [12, 177]]], "tags": ["multi"]}

The majority of people no longer assume that southpaws are tools of Satan, alight with hellfire. Today’s lefties are surrounded by a far more benevolent glow. We associate left-handedness with intelligence, out-of-the-box thinking, and artistic talent. But are these flattering generalizations backed up by science? Does being left-handed really make you more creative?", "The answer to that is a definitive ... maybe.", "Scientists have been chipping away at the peculiarities of left-handedness, which occurs in about 10 percent of the population, for a long time. They’ve looked into the purported links between left-handedness and things like mental illness, faulty immune systems, and criminal behavior. They’ve studied whether lefties are better at problem-solving, and if they’re more likely to die young. From all these studies on left-handedness, we can conclude one thing, and one thing alone: science is complicated.", "A handful of studies have found a link between left-handedness and creativity, conferred, some think, by the fact that left-handed folks constantly have to adjust to a right-handed world. Other studies found no link at all.", "Some researchers conclude that lefties are no smarter than righties, while others say that left-handedness comes with a clear intellectual advantage. Is there really a left-handed personality? Are lefties more prone to schizophrenia and learning disabilities? That depends on who you ask.", "But \"Are lefties different?\" might not even be the right question. Over the last few years, a number of studies have concluded that it’s not which hand is dominant that matters—it’s the degree of dominance. According to researchers, very few people are truly entirely left- or right-handed; it’s more of a spectrum. We use our left hands for some things and our right hands for other tasks.", "These experiments have found that people toward the middle of the spectrum are more flexible thinkers. They seem to be more empathetic and better able to view things from other people’s perspectives. When considering the risks and benefits of any given decision, inconsistent-handed people (as researchers call them) are more likely to focus on the risks, whereas people at the outer edges of the handedness spectrum pay more attention to potential benefits. They may even sleep differently. It seems we’ve been aiming our stereotypes a little too far to the left.", "But who knows? This is ever-changing, constantly evolving science.

You can’t have a \"mass shooting\" without some political ladder-climber coming down hard on the rights of law-abiding Americans. And this time it is Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. She published this in The Boston Globe today.", "The Massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban Congress allowed to expire in 2004. It prohibits the sale of specific weapons like the Colt AR-15 and AK-47 and explicitly bans \"copies or duplicates\" of those weapons. But gun manufacturers have taken it upon themselves to define what a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" weapon is. They market \"state compliant\" copycat versions of their assault weapons to Massachusetts buyers. They sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon. That will end now. On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts. With this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers. The directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" of a prohibited weapon. If a gun’s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a banned weapon, it’s a \"copy\" or \"duplicate,\" and it is illegal. Assault weapons prohibited under our laws cannot be altered in any way to make their sale or possession legal in Massachusetts.", "Yes, you’ve read correctly. Every black rifle, and all of the variants, compliant versions, and anything that any of these yokels think might be used for an \"assault\" is now strictly illegal.", "What about all of those guns currently in the law-abiding hands of law-abiding gun owners?", "We recognize that most residents who purchased these guns in the past believed they were doing so legally, so this directive will not apply to possession of guns purchased before Wednesday. In the dozen years since the federal assault weapons ban lapsed, only seven states have instituted their own assault weapons ban. Many of those bans have been challenged (unsuccessfully) by the gun industry, and we anticipate our directive may be too. But our job is to enforce state laws and to keep people safe. This directive does both.", "Right. Because the criminals who are shooting up campuses and theaters and police protests–they’re all easily stopped by enacting a simple bit of legislation.

Not only do we have the legal authority to do so, we have a moral obligation to do so.", "Wait–to get the guns off the street?

A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center found that getting a flu shot reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 71.4 percent for all adults and 76.8 percent for those over age 50 during the 2011-2012 flu season.", "The CDC estimates deaths associated with the flu number between 3,000 and 49,000 people each year.", "One reason people don't get vaccinated is cost. Flu shots aren't always free. Most insurance does cover vaccinations administered at a doctor's office. But walk into your local CVS or Walgreen and you'll likely pay at least $35. Insurance won't necessarily cover shots at retail pharmacies.", "Employers can help bring down those costs - and likely save themselves money as well. The CDC estimates that seasonal influenza outbreaks average $10.4 billion in direct costs due to medical treatment and hospitalizations. Part of those costs are then passed along to employers in the form of higher premiums and lost productivity.", "Typically, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized each year for flu-related illness. Many large firms like Walsh's offer free flu shot clinics, but letting workers know they won't be penalized for taking sick leave can also pay dividends for businesses big and small.", "Last winter was a big year for influenza, and it caught many patients and healthcare providers off-guard after several years of milder flu seasons. It's too early to know how this year's will compare or even how many people have come down with the flu so far this autumn since those numbers, tracked by the CDC, weren't reported during the recent government shutdown.", "Flu activity usually peaks in the United States in January or February. Recent studies from the European Union show the vaccine offers less immunity and has a shorter duration than previously thought, according to Kris Ehresmann, director of the infectious disease division at the Minnesota Department of Health. \"But now is the time to get vaccinated,\" she adds.", "What's new this year, says Dr. Michael Jhung, medical officer at the CDC, is that many flu shots will immunize against four strains of the flu virus for the first time, an improved protection over years past. Drug companies plan to make 135 million to 139 million doses of vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration.", "Several vaccination options are available. They include: a standard dose for adults and children, a high-dose shot for people over age 65, a nasal spray for those who don't like needles, and a dose that is egg-free for patients who are allergic.", "Everyone over the age of 6 months should get one, experts say. \"We don't prefer one vaccine over another,\" Jhung says. \"Whatever vaccine patients choose, we're happy.\"", "The elderly, children under age 5, pregnant women, and people with other chronic health conditions are most vulnerable to the flu.", "Getting immunized earlier guarantees protection whenever the flu season starts in earnest, Jhung notes. Plus, adults who don't get vaccinated can put others, including children, at risk.

He says the media using criticism of Matt Lauer's performance during a candidates forum this month to pressure the moderators into attack mode.", "\"They're hitting Matt Lauer, and that's sort of indicative of what they're — they're trying to game the system,\" Trump told Fox News last weekend. \"They want — and this, I think, is terrible — they want the hosts to go after Trump. And that's what they're doing by gaming the system.\"", "Conspiratorial as Trump's theory is, it can't be disproven. But the shot he took at Holt can be.", "\"Lester is a Democrat,\" Trump told Bill O'Reilly last week. \"It’s a phony system. They are all Democrats. It’s a very unfair system.\"", "These are the people who will be lobbing questions at Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton when they go head-to-head at the 2016 presidential debates. The first debate is slated for September 26. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)", "Time magazine checked the voter rolls in New York, and it turns out Holt is actually a registered Republican. Trump still might find things to complain about Monday night, but a case for partisan bias against him will be tough to make.", "Holt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992", "Holt, whose grandparents immigrated to the United Stats from Jamaica, is the first black moderator of a general election presidential debate since Carole Simpson in 1992. Gwen Ifill moderated vice-presidential debates in 2004 and 2008, and Bernard Shaw moderated the VP debate in 2000, but it has been 24 years since a black journalist moderated a debate between the major-party nominees for president.", "Holt, whom NBC declined to make available for interviews before the debate, does not talk about his race often. He did say this to the Chicago Tribune in 1995, when the paper profiled the then-anchor of WBBM-TV's nightly newscast: \"Everyone knows I'm black. I am who I am. This is the person that Lester Sr. and June Holt raised, and I make no apology for it. At the same time, I'm never going to pull a race card to get what I want. You can't have it both ways.\"", "Dominic Carter, a fellow black TV journalist who moderated one of Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign debates in 2006, said Holt's selection is significant, but viewers should not expect his background to influence his questioning.", "\"We are journalists first,\" Carter said. \"That's a huge distinction. We're not there to advocate on issues relating to African Americans. We're there advocating and asking questions on behalf of the American people. You don't want people to put you in the box of the black guy doing the debate. So you have to be over and above in terms of fairness and professionalism.\"", "He's not really into the Twitter", "Holt, 57, has not tweeted in almost a month.

As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?\"", "Holt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree", "Apparently the secret to becoming a big-time political anchor is not graduating from college. \"Meet the Press\" anchor Chuck Todd never finished his studies at George Washington University.

When people don't feel they're supported because they're constantly wanting for resources, they eventually burn out. But many companies fail to address these needs within their sales department, and they end up losing their top representatives because of it.", "Becoming Sales Intelligent", "Modern technology didn't create a training or resource crisis, but it did change the types of tools and training that social selling requires. Rapidly shifting sales techniques demand a proactive attitude toward salesforce development. Productivity tools have enabled salespeople to work smarter and spend more time interfacing with clients than managing mundane tasks. The flip side of this is that prospects and customers expect rapid results and constant access. Sales teams must be prepared for the 24/7 nature of their jobs.", "This is where sales intelligence comes in. Sales and marketing overlap more than ever before.

Now, a multitude of services help businesses identify prospects, collect contact information, load the data into their CRMs, and schedule drip campaigns. In this sense, many sales reps are operating their own mini-marketing departments.", "Sales intelligence encompasses this entire data-gathering process. It includes all the contextual information you need about your sales contacts: purchase histories, industries, response rates, and other metrics that help you tailor your strategies to each target. The better you know your audience, the more effective your campaigns will be. That's Sales 101.

The proposal is still missing some important details, though. For starters, it’s still unclear if Facebook itself will develop the buildings or hire a third party.

I don’t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it’s likely Sanders will see it this way, too.", "To get all the details on Trump’s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer’s piece. Trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue GOP agenda of \"fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production.\" More important, with some reporters wondering what Trump’s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: He is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we’re currently putting in place to deal with it.", "Trump said that the current environmental challenges that the Obama administration is trying to tackle are \"phony.\" He added that he would \"rescind\" the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the U.S.’s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. He would withdraw the U.S. from participation in that global accord.", "As I’ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a Republican president — even one as masterfully competent and strong as Trump — to roll back the Clean Power Plan and/or withdraw from the Paris climate deal. But it’s possible that Trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback.", "This deepens the contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton.

But Sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it — and the Clean Power Plan — are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe.

Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. What’s more, even if the Paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. The accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. Obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible.", "It is often said that Sanders may not help to unify the party because he has \"nothing to lose\" from a Democratic loss. I think that is wrong — I believe Sanders when he says a Trump presidency is unthinkable. And at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor Sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement’s influence going forward. Trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by Sanders’ own lights, we all have to lose from a Trump presidency.

And marriage is not one of those cheesy status updates on Facebook with words like \"soul mates\" and \"#soblessed.\"", "Marriage is hard work, and there will be difficult times now and then. Because when you share your freaking life with someone else—raising a family and building careers, paying taxes and choosing Netflix shows—it is impossible not to get bogged down in the muck now and then.", "But you will get through it. You will remember that you’re on the same team. You will fight, and then you will forgive. You will compromise. You will get therapy if you need to. You will take a deep breath, flip each other off, and then laugh at yourselves.", "So fear not, you are not alone. Marriage is hard for everyone now and then. And making it through those sucky stretches might even make your marriage better. Because even though marriage has its hard and shitty days, marriage is also knowing you have someone on your side who will hold an umbrella over you when the shit hits the fan."], "targetTitle": "What No One Tells You About Marriage", "targetDescription": "Let's cut to the chase already.

Exclusive by @ritholtz:"], "postPlatform": "Twitter", "targetParagraphs": ["How much compensation the folks at Pacific Investment Management Co., better known as Pimco, haul in each year has always been a topic of fascination on Wall Street.", "In 2012, news reports suggested that the firm's top 30 partners \"pulled down an average $33 million a year in compensation in recent years.\" A subsequent column by Felix Salmon guessed that the average investment professional at Pimco was making \"roughly $7 million each\" annually.", "A Pimco spokesman denied Salmon's claim, responding that \"The numbers cited in your blog post today are wildly inaccurate.\"", "Salmon's speculation was, indeed, wildly inaccurate -- to the downside. Actual bonuses at Pimco are higher, much higher, than probably any outsiders previously believed. Based on news reports, public records and new data obtained by Bloomberg View, it appears that Pimco had a 2013 bonus pool for its 60 managing directors of almost $1.5 billion.", "So how much have Pimco's top executives earned? According to documents provided to Bloomberg View by someone with knowledge of Pimco's bonus policies, the numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013. Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's former chief executive officer and one-time heir apparent to Gross, received $230 million (El-Erian is a fellow Bloomberg View contributor).", "And the story doesn't end with Pimco's two most visible (former) employees. Former deputy chief investment officer Daniel Ivascyn -- now serving as Gross's replacement as Pimco's chief investment officer -- took home a $70 million bonus. Wendy W. Cupps, the global head of product management, garnered $50 million, making her one of the highest-paid woman in finance. (Her rocky push into equities was the subject of well-publicized haranguing by Gross.) Douglas Hodge, now the CEO, took home $45 million of holiday cheer. These giant bonuses almost make the $22 million awarded to Pimco’s president, Jay Jacobs, seem puny.", "The top three managers after Gross and El-Erian -- Ivascyn, Cupps and Jacobs -- were rumored to have been behind the coup that sent Gross packing to Janus Capital in September. Next month, free of Gross and El-Erian, these three will have an extra half a billion or so to keep to themselves or distribute to the other managing directors.", "Gross’s bonus -- 20 percent of the total bonus pool for 2013 -- places him in a compensation class of his very own. To put that figure into context, in 2013 Gross made just shy of what the next 20 publicly held finance company CEOs made combined.", "In the world of sports, you would have to take the total salaries, winnings and endorsement deals of LeBron James, Lionel Messi, Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods and Roger Federer -- together -- to be on par with Gross.", "* * *", "How Pimco became such an earnings machine is a quirk.", "It has been four decades since it was spun out of Pacific Life Insurance Co., a move that was made in part to allow Gross a freer hand to manage the insurer’s fixed income portfolio. Since then, Pimco has grown into a behemoth, in terms of the bottom line and as a force in the bond market.", "Much of what we know about Pimco stems from Allianz SE's $3.3 billion purchase of 70 percent of the firm in 2000. A publicly traded German insurer, Allianz has released some details about Pimco’s operations in its quarterly earnings reports. That data, along with mutual fund disclosures and filings, provide hints about the firm’s revenue.", "We can estimate earnings by looking at the largest Pimco funds. The 20 biggest have an average fee of about 61 basis points. Let’s lower that to account for discounts given to large institutional clients, and we get a rough estimate of about 50 basis points. On $1.82 trillion dollars, that yields $9.1 billion in revenue a year.", "Pimco is, by any measure, a fabulously wealthy company. Using my back-of-the-envelope revenue estimate, it generates far more revenue per employee than any bank or asset manager -- almost four times as much as Goldman Sachs.", "When Allianz bought into Pimco, it picked up about $250 billion in assets under management. Pimco currently manages about $2 trillion.", "The bonus structure is a quirk of that original deal: Allianz’ partial purchase left Pacific Life owning 30 percent of Pimco. But Pacific Life wasn't interested in running the asset-management business and even after the Allianz deal, everyone involved continued to defer to Gross’s financial and managerial judgment.", "Thus Pimco -- based in Newport beach, California, and 6,000 miles removed from its majority owners -- remained fully autonomous. Bloomberg View's fee analysis suggests Allianz takes about 70 percent of the total revenue Pimco generates annually (plus or minus a few percentage points). Pimco keeps the rest.", "This same deal structure continued even after Allianz purchased the 30 percent of Pimco that it didn't already own from Pacific Life in the mid-2000s. A subsequent restructuring in 2011 saw Gross and his team gain even greater control over the firm. That gave Pimco so much freedom in relation to its corporate parent that, as one analyst described it to Bloomberg News, it appeared as if it was \"the tail wagging the dog.\"", "* * *", "Part of the reason for Gross's longevity after the Allianz takeover -- and another element of the firm's enormous wealth -- is what we might call the \"Pimco Premium.\" Despite being in a competitive field including giant companies such as Vanguard and Blackrock, Pimco manages to charge more than the industry standard for access to its funds and its separately managed accounts.", "Why? When competing for business, the firm has had an unbeatable combination of a long history and outstanding long-term results. (At least it did, until recent bad bets on rising interest rates by Gross torpedoed the 1-, 3- and 5-year record of the flagship Total Return Fund.)", "Pimco also became the go-to company for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury in many of the credit facilities used to combat the continuing economic fallout from the financial crisis. Pimco's success in the federal government's program to jumpstart consumer lending and a variety of mortgage-backed security programs added more luster to its reputation. Gross even managed to buy up lots of MBS's before the Fed officially announced the programs. Shareholders of the Total Return Fund netted about $10 billion from its mortgage plays.", "Beyond the sheer size of Pimco's bonuses, there are other aspects of its compensation practices that should give pause to everyone involved in institutional asset management.", "For one, Pimco has been part of a publicly traded company -- Allianz -- for the past 15 years. Unbeknownst to Allianz's shareholders, employees of one of its business units have been paying themselves these extraordinarily large sums of money.", "In the U.S., it is hard to imagine $1.5 billion in spending on anything not being disclosed. Almost 16 percent of Pimco's revenue is a \"material\" amount of money that would normally require disclosure in the U.S. But Allianz is a German company, subject to different regulations.", "Another item worth noticing: Pimco investors represent pension funds, foundations, charitable trusts, 401ks and other retirement accounts. Pimco's enormous, self-paid bonuses come right off of the top of the returns those outside investors might otherwise receive.", "In a recent Allianz presentation following Gross' departure from Pimco, the firm's new chief executive, Doug Hodge, stated, \"We don't comment on matters of compensation.\"", "But while Gross may be gone, the high fees and compensation structure at Pimco appear to remain firmly in place. Allianz doesn't seem inclined to change things -- it started a $279 million award program this fall to keep people from following Gross out the door.", "However, if there is going to be change, it can only come from Pimco's big institutional customers. Why should they pay a Pimco Premium? Pimco's profits are down by 7.9 percent in the third quarter of this year, and the firm saw saw almost $50 billion in outflows last month. Janus, Gross's new home, has managed to attract only about $430 million in new money since he joined.", "The market for fixed income asset management has never been in greater flux than it is today. The realignment of power among bond managers is only just beginning. If ever there was a moment when investors could demand more competitive fees from their bond managers, it is now.", "Perhaps it might also be a good time for Pimco itself to consider slicing its fees. Anecdotally, stories abound of Pimco institutional salespeople offering steep one-year fee discounts as a way to retain assets.", "If I were managing Pimco (even from 6,000 miles away), I would be looking at ways to make those fee reductions more permanent. I bet I even could find close to a billion and a half dollars in savings."], "targetTitle": "Guess How Much Money Bill Gross Made Last Year?", "targetDescription": "The numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013.", "targetKeywords": "Money,Earnings,Investment Management,Wall Street,Bond Market,Fixed Income,Sports,California,Wealth,Interest Rates,Federal Reserve,U.S. Treasury,Retirement", "targetMedia": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/idaOcRVeUxoY/v1/120x120.jpg", "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKzjInUDN4qE/v1/1200x-1.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iKzjInUDN4qE/v1/1200x-1.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iz9_DLhdXefQ/v1/120x120.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i1JWQKZPC96A/v1/120x120.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iui7bQYay2Cc/v1/120x120.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/izgCxnl7Ri4I/v1/120x120.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ijfX17VuNa34/v1/120x120.jpg", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iK2WFiEHsevU/v0/120x120.png"], "targetUrl": "http://bv.ms/1ut6B6e", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "$290,000,000", "spoilerPublisher": "SavedYouAClick"}, "spoiler": ["$290 million"], "spoilerPositions": [[[4, 198], [4, 210]]], "tags": ["phrase"]}

They recommend voting for a third-party or write-in candidate.", "As a professor who has taught Christian ethics for 39 years, I think their analysis is incorrect. Now that Trump has won the GOP nomination, I think voting for Trump is a morally good choice.", "American citizens need patience with each other in this difficult political season. Close friends are inevitably going to make different decisions about the election. We still need to respect each other and thank God that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics. And we need to keep talking with each other – because democracies function best when thoughtful citizens can calmly and patiently dialog about the reasons for their differences. This is my contribution to that discussion.", "A good candidate with flaws", "I do not think that voting for Donald Trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. In fact, it is the morally right thing to do.", "I did not support Trump in the primary season. I even spoke against him at a pastors’ conference in February. But now I plan to vote for him. I do not think it is right to call him an \"evil candidate.\" I think rather he is a good candidate with flaws.", "He is egotistical, bombastic, and brash. He often lacks nuance in his statements. Sometimes he blurts out mistaken ideas (such as bombing the families of terrorists) that he later must abandon. He insults people. He can be vindictive when people attack him. He has been slow to disown and rebuke the wrongful words and actions of some angry fringe supporters. He has been married three times and claims to have been unfaithful in his marriages. These are certainly flaws, but I don’t think they are disqualifying flaws in this election.", "On the other hand, I think some of the accusations hurled against him are unjustified. His many years of business conduct show that he is not racist or anti-(legal) immigrant or anti-Semitic or misogynistic – I think these are unjust magnifications by a hostile press exaggerating some careless statements he has made. I think he is deeply patriotic and sincerely wants the best for the country. He has been an unusually successful problem solver in business. He has raised remarkable children. Many who have known him personally speak highly of his kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity. But the main reason I call him \"a good candidate with flaws\" is that I think most of the policies he supports are those that will do the most good for the nation.", "Seek the good of the nation", "Should Christians even try to influence elections at all? Yes, definitely. The apostle Peter says Christians are \"exiles\" on this earth (1 Peter 1:1). Therefore I take seriously the prophet Jeremiah’s exhortation to the Jewish people living in exile in Babylon:", "\"Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare\" (Jeremiah 29:7).", "By way of modern application, I think Christians today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will \"seek the welfare\" of the United States. Therefore the one overriding question to ask is this: Which vote is most likely to bring the best results for the nation?", "If this election is close (which seems likely), then if someone votes for a write-in candidate instead of voting for Trump, this action will directly help Hillary Clinton, because she will need one less vote to win. Therefore the question that Christians should ask is this: Can I in good conscience act in a way that helps a liberal like Hillary Clinton win the presidency?", "Under President Obama, a liberal federal government has seized more and more control over our lives. But this can change. This year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat Hillary Clinton and the pro-abortion, pro-gender-confusion, anti-religious liberty, tax-and-spend, big government liberalism that she champions. I believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right action. Therefore I feel the force of the words of James: \"Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin\" (James 4:17).", "Some may feel it is easier just to stay away from this messy Trump-Clinton election, and perhaps not even vote. But the teachings of Scripture do not allow us to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing. The prophet Obadiah rebuked the people of the Edom for standing by and doing nothing to help when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem: \"On the day that you stood aloof, on the day that . . . foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.\" (Obadiah 1:11).", "I am writing this article because I doubt that many \"I can’t vote for Trump\" Christians have understood what an entirely different nation would result from Hillary Clinton as president, or have analyzed in detail how different a Trump presidency would be. In what follows, I will compare the results we could expect from a Clinton presidency with what we could expect from a Trump presidency.", "The Supreme Court with Clinton as president", "Hillary Clinton would quickly replace Justice Scalia with another liberal like Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. This would give liberals a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court even without Justice Kennedy, and 6-3 when he votes with them.", "But that is not all. Justice Ginsburg is 83, and she has had colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and has a heart stent. Justice Kennedy is 80. Justice Breyer is 78. A President Clinton could possibly nominate three or four justices to the Supreme Court, locking in a far-left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more years. She could also add dozens of activist judges to federal district courts and courts of appeals, the courts where 99% of federal lawsuits are decided. Judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion rights and same-sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph.", "The nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree. And there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them.", "That is why this election is not just about Hillary Clinton. It is about defeating the far left liberal agenda that any Democratic nominee would champion. Liberal Democrats are now within one Supreme Court justice of their highest goal: gaining permanent control of the nation with a five vote majority on the Supreme Court, and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning elections but through a relentless parade of one Supreme Court decision after another.", "Even if Clinton were to drop out of the race (perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosures, for example), our choice in the election would be just the same, because any other Democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justices to the Court.", "Abortion", "On abortion, a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial-birth abortion to be unconstitutional (it was upheld by only a 5-4 majority in Gonzalez v. Carhart, 2007). In addition, the court could find an absolute \"right to abortion\" in the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restrictions on abortion that pro-life advocates worked for tirelessly over the last 43 years, including ultrasound requirements, waiting periods, parental consent requirements, and prohibitions on non-doctors performing abortions.", "Voters should not doubt the power of the Supreme Court to abolish all these laws restricting abortions. Think of the power of the Obergefell v. Hodges 5-4 decision in June, 2015. It instantly nullified all the work that thousands of Christians had done over many years in persuading the citizens of 31 states to pass constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. But no one is campaigning for such laws or amendments anymore, because it would be futile. The Supreme Court has spoken, and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the United States. We lost – not at the ballot box, but because we had a liberal Supreme Court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage.", "So it would certainly be with any efforts to place legal limitations on abortion. Nobody would campaign any more for laws to limit abortions, because any such laws would be unconstitutional. The legislative lobbying work of pro-life advocacy groups would be totally and utterly defeated. Millions of unborn children would continue to die.", "Religious liberty", "The current liberal agenda often includes suppressing Christian opposition to its views. So a liberal court would increasingly nullify rights of conscience with respect to forced participation in same-sex marriage ceremonies or expressing moral objections to homosexual conduct. Already Christians are being pushed out of many occupations. Florists, bakers, and professional photographers have had their businesses destroyed by large fines for refusal to contribute their artistic talents to a specific event, a same-sex wedding ceremony to which they had moral objections.", "Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran in Atlanta was removed from his job because of self-publishing a religious book that briefly mentioned the Bible’s teachings regarding non-marital sexual conduct, including homosexuality, amidst a host of other topics. His situation holds ominous implications for any Christians who hold public sector jobs. In our military services, many high-ranking officers have quietly been forced to resign because they were unwilling to give support to the homosexual agenda.", "Mozilla/Firefox CEO Brendan Eich was pushed out from his own company merely because he had donated money to Proposition 8 in California, supporting marriage between one man and one woman. This event has troubling implications for Christians in any corporate executive role who dare to support a political position contrary to the liberal agenda.", "Last year Boston urologist Paul Church, a Harvard Medical School faculty member, lost his hospital privileges at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center because he had expressed concerns about the medical dangers associated with same-sex activity.", "Are my predictions about this kind of loss of religious liberty too grim? The three conservative justices still on the Supreme Court expressed similar concerns just last month. The case concerned a Washington pharmacy that has been owned for 70 years by the Stormans family, who are committed Christians. They will likely now be put out of business by the Washington State Pharmacy Board for refusing to dispense an abortion-causing prescription drug. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to hear the Stormans’ appeal, in spite of the strong dissent written by Justice Alito (joined by Roberts and Thomas):", "\"At issue are Washington State regulations that are likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she objects on religious grounds to dispensing certain prescription medications. . . . . there is much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulations was hostility to pharmacists whose religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the State . . . . If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern.\" (italics added)", "Christian business owners", "If Clinton appoints just one more liberal justice, it is likely that many Christian business owners will be targeted. Hobby Lobby won its 2014 Supreme Court case (again 5-4), so it was not compelled to dispense abortifacients to its employees, but that case could be reversed (the four liberal justices in the minority, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, are still on the court). If that case is overturned, it would force Hobby Lobby out of business, because the Green family had said they would shut down the company of 23,000 employees and over $3 billion in annual sales if they lost the decision. The implications for other Christian business owners with pro-life convictions are ominous.", "These incidents show that it is not an exaggeration to say that, under a liberal Supreme Court resulting from Hillary Clinton’s election, Christians would increasingly experience systematic exclusion from hundreds of occupations, with thousands of people losing their jobs. Step-by-step, Christians would increasingly be marginalized to the silent fringes of society. Is withholding a vote from Donald Trump important enough to pay this high a price in loss of freedom?", "Some Christians have even hinted to me that \"persecution would be good for us.\" But the Bible never encourages us to seek persecution or hope for it. We should rather work to prevent such oppression of Christians, just as Jesus taught us to pray, \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil\" (Matthew 6:13). Paul did not encourage us to pray that God would give us bad rulers but good ones who would allow us to live a peaceful life:", "\"I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.\" (1Timothy 2:1)", "Christian schools and colleges", "A liberal Supreme Court would also impact education. Christian colleges would likely be found guilty of \"discrimination\" if they required adherence to the Bible’s standards regarding sexual conduct, or even required affirmation of primary Christian beliefs. Campus ministries like Cru and InterVarsity have already been forced off of many university campuses following the 5-4 Supreme Court decision CLS v. Martinez (2010), which upheld the exclusion of the Christian Legal Society from the campus of Hastings College of Law in San Francisco. And now California’s Equity in Higher Education Act (SB 1146), which recently passed the California state senate and will likely become law, would prohibit Christian colleges from requiring students or employees to hold Christian beliefs or abide by biblical moral standards regarding sexual conduct, and would prohibit colleges from assigning housing based on a student’s biological sex if a student claimed to be transgender. Colleges like Biola and Azusa Pacific could not long survive under those regulations.", "With regard to elementary and high schools, laws promoting school choice or tuition voucher programs would likely be declared unconstitutional if they allowed such funding to go to Christian schools. A tax credit program for scholarships to private schools, including Christian institutions, was only upheld by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn in 2011, and all four liberal justices who voted against it are still on the court. Another possible target of the liberal agenda would be laws that allow for home schooling, if the secular/ liberal governmental hostility to home schooling in European countries is any indicator.", "Churches", "Churches would not be exempt from the impact of a liberal Supreme Court. The court could rule that any school district is allowed to ban churches from renting school buildings on Sundays, an action that could severely hinder the work of small churches and church planting in general. (This was already the ruling of the Second Circuit in the Bronx Household of Faith case regarding New York City public schools.) And some churches in Iowa have now been told that they have to make their bathrooms open to people on the basis of their \"gender identity\" if the churches are going to be open to the public at all.", "Freedom of speech", "Freedom of speech would be increasingly restricted in the public square. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that prayers of visiting pastors who prayed \"in Jesus’ name\" when they opened a city council meeting were allowed under the Constitution, but again it was a 5-4 decision (Town of Greece v. Galloway) and all four liberals who wanted to restrict such prayers are still on the court.", "Criminalizing dissent", "Another troubling possibility is that liberal activists, once in power, would further entrench themselves by criminalizing much political dissent. We have already seen it happen with the IRS targeting of conservative groups and with some state attorneys general taking steps to prosecute (!) groups who dare to disagree with activists’ claims about the danger of man-made global warming.", "\"But my conscience won’t let me vote for Donald Trump,\" some have told me. But I wonder if their consciences have considered the gravity of these destructive consequences that would come from a Clinton presidency. A vote for Trump would at least be doing something to prevent these things.", "In addition, I think there are several positive reasons to vote for Trump.", "The Supreme Court with Trump as president", "Trump has released a list of 11 judges to show the kind of nominee he would appoint to the Supreme Court. A lawyer familiar with many of these names has told me that they constitute a \"dream list\" of outstanding judges who would uphold the original meaning of the Constitution and would not create new laws from the bench. Trump has said he would rely primarily on advice from the Federalist Society, the organization that promotes the \"original meaning\" view so strongly exemplified by Justice Scalia before his death.", "If Trump would appoint a replacement for Scalia from his list of 11, and probably one or two other Supreme Court justices, then we could see a 5-4 or even 6-3 majority of conservative justices on the Supreme Court. The results for the nation would be overwhelmingly good.", "Such a Supreme Court would finally return control of the nation to the people and their elected representatives, removing it from dictatorial judges who repeatedly make law from the bench.", "Abortion", "Such a court would likely overturn Roe v. Wade and return abortion laws and the regulation of abortion to the states.", "Religious liberty", "A conservative court would vigorously uphold the First Amendment, protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech for Christian colleges, Christian ministries, and churches.", "Such a court would likely overturn the horribly destructive decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) that changed the meaning of the First Amendment and ruled that a government action \"must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion\" (note: not a specific denomination but \"religion\" in general). A conservative court would likely declare that the First Amendment was only intended to prohibit the establishment of a state-sponsored church or denomination.", "Such a decision would once again allow the nonsectarian affirmation of personal belief in God in public schools, would once again allow coaches to pray with their football teams before a game, and would allow visiting clergy to be invited to give a prayer at high school graduation ceremonies. It would also imply that nativity scenes without Santa Claus and Buddha should be allowed in government-owned parks and buildings at Christmas time. It wouldn’t require these things, but would allow them if local officials chose to approve them. It would restore true freedom of religion as the First Amendment intended.", "It would also protect freedom of conscience for Christians who object to participating in abortions, or dispensing abortifacient medicines, or who do not wish to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies. It is also possible that a conservative Supreme Court would eventually return control of marriage to the states.", "Freedom for Christian influence in politics", "Significantly, Trump has pledged to work to repeal the 1954 Johnson Amendment to the IRS code, which has been used for 62 years as a threat to silence pastors from speaking about political issues, for fear of losing their tax-exempt status. This would be a great victory for freedom of religion and freedom of speech.", "In short, a Trump-appointed Supreme Court, together with dozens of lower court judges appointed by him, would probably result in significant advances in many of the policy areas important to Christians. It would also open the door to huge expansion of influence for the many Christian lobbying groups known as \"family policy councils\" in various states, especially enabling them to work for further legal protections for life, for marriage and family, and for religious liberty.", "How can we know that Trump won’t change his mind?", "\"But Trump has changed his mind in the past,\" a politically-minded friend said to me. \"How do you know that he will do what he has promised? Maybe he’ll betray you and appoint a liberal Supreme Court justice.\"", "My reply is that we can never know the future conduct of any human being with 100% certainty, but in making an ethical decision like this one, we should base the decision on the most likely results. In this case, the most likely result is that Trump will do most or all of what he has said.", "In the history of American politics, candidates who have been elected president have occasionally changed their minds on one or another issue while in office, but no president has ever gone back on most of what he has promised to do, especially on issues that are crucially important in the election. In this election, it is reasonable to think that the most likely result is that both Trump and Clinton will do what they have promised to do. That is the basis on which we should decide how to vote.", "And notice how Trump has changed his mind. He continues to move in a more conservative direction, as evidenced by his list of judges and his choice for vice president. Just as he succeeded in business by listening to the best experts to solve each problem, I suspect that he has been learning from the best experts in conservative political thought and has increasingly found that conservative solutions really work. We should applaud these changes.", "His choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate is an especially significant indication that he will govern as a conservative. Trump could have picked a moderate but instead picked a lifelong solid conservative who is a thoughtful, gracious policy wizard. Pence is a lawyer and former talk radio host who served 12 years in Congress and had significant congressional leadership positions, so he will be immensely helpful in working with Congress. He is a committed evangelical Christian. He is a former board member of the Indiana Family Institute, a conservative Christian lobbying group in Indiana.", "However, the Supreme Court is not the only issue at stake in this election. While I disagree with Trump on a few things (especially trade policy), on most important issues, Trump will likely do much good for the nation.", "Taxes and jobs", "Trump has pledged to cut taxes significantly, while Clinton wants to raise them. Trump is advocating a 15% tax rate for corporations rather than the current 35%. Lower corporate taxes would lead to business expansion and a massive increase in available jobs and higher pay levels. For individual taxpayers, Trump favors a top rate of 25%, but for Clinton it’s 45%. Most small businesses file under this individual rate, so once again Trump’s lower taxes would result in substantial expansion of businesses and many more jobs. Finally our economy would snap out of its eight years of anemic growth.", "In my judgment, Christians should support lower tax rates that would lead to more jobs, because Obama’s economic policies for the last eight years have hurt lower income and low-middle income families the most. Many can’t even find jobs, and others can’t find full-time jobs. Those who have jobs struggle to survive with no meaningful pay raises year after year. It is no surprise that these are the people who are supporting Trump in overwhelming numbers.", "Tax rates are also a good indicator of government control. Higher tax rates mean greater government control of our lives, while lower tax rates indicate greater freedom.", "Minorities", "Two of the deepest causes of poverty among minority groups and racial tensions in our country are failing public schools in our inner cities and lack of available jobs. Trump expressed a commitment to solve these problems at several points in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention. He pledged to reduce taxes and regulations, leading to many more jobs. And he said:", "\"Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are not employed . . . . This administration has failed America’s inner cities. It’s failed them on education. It’s failed and on jobs. It’s failed them on crime . . . . Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? . . . . We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\"", "By contrast, Clinton will bow to the teachers’ unions and oppose school choice at every turn, and she will continue to strangle businesses with high taxes and regulations, preventing job growth.", "The military", "Trump has promised to rapidly rebuild our depleted military forces, but Clinton would continue the liberal policy of eviscerating them through denying funding. This is dangerous in light of increasing threats from China, Russia, Iran, and ISIS.", "Borders", "Trump has repeatedly promised that he will finally secure our borders, an urgent need to protect the nation from ever more terrorists and drug smugglers. Clinton will not do this but will continue to allow in what she thinks will be thousands of future Democratic voters.", "ISIS and terrorism", "Trump has pledged to aggressively attack and utterly defeat ISIS. Clinton will continue the anemic Obama policy of periodic bombing runs and drone attacks, under which ISIS has continued to thrive.", "China and Russia", "Trump will not let China and Russia and Iran push us around anymore, as Obama has done, with Hillary Clinton’s support when she was secretary of state. If Trump is anything, he is tough as nails, and he won’t be bullied.", "Israel", "Trump has promised to vigorously defend and support Israel, while Clinton will most likely continue the Obama administration’s criticism, snubbing, and marginalization of Israel.", "Energy", "Trump has said he will approve the Keystone oil pipeline and grant more oil drilling permits leading to lower energy costs and providing thousands of jobs. Lower energy costs help everybody, but the poor most of all. Clinton, by contrast, will make fracking nearly impossible and essentially abolish the coal industry, causing energy prices to skyrocket.", "Executive orders and bathrooms", "Trump has promised to rescind many of the most objectionable executive orders given by President Obama, so he will likely end the compulsory moral degradation forced on us by a liberal agenda, including orders forcing schools to allow boys in girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms, in defiance of the will of the vast majority of Americans. But Hillary Clinton would likely perpetuate and expand these policies.", "Health care", "Trump will work to repeal Obamacare, which is ruining the nation’s health care system, and replace it with an affordable free market system in which companies have the ability to sell insurance across state lines, thus substantially lowering insurance prices especially in those states that currently allow only high-priced \"Cadillac\" insurance plans. But Clinton would continue to work relentlessly toward federal government control of our entire health care industry.", "The unprotected", "Trump will finally begin to recognize and protect what Wall Street Journal writer Peggy Noonan calls \"the unprotected\" in America -- people in lower income areas who cannot find good jobs, cannot find good schools for their children, do not feel protected from crime, and find their retirement savings are not enough because for years they have been earning no interest in the bank. Trump said in his acceptance speech, \"Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across the nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned . . . I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.\"", "These American citizens recognize that Trump has built a business career on listening to experts, solving problems, and getting things done. They realize that Trump didn’t earn $4 billion by being stupid, and their instinct says that he might be exactly the right person to solve some of the biggest problems in a nation that has for too long been headed in the wrong direction and stuck in political gridlock.", "They may not have college degrees but their old-fashioned common sense tells them that America would be a much better place if we no longer had to be afraid to say \"Merry Christmas,\" or that boys are different from girls, or that Islamic terrorists are Islamic terrorists. They’re sick and tired of being condescended to by the snobbish moralism of the liberal elites who dominate the power centers in our nation. That is why they cheer when Trump repeatedly violates the canons of politically correct speech.

How much do you really know about them, though?", "What Is Melatonin?", "For starters, melatonin is a For starters, melatonin is a hormone released by the brain that helps regulate the body's circadian rhythm (aka your internal clock), explains David Lee, MD, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the UCSF Fresno Medical Education Program. \"It's secreted by the pineal gland, which is at the base of the brain, and regulated by light,\" he says. \"It's a natural hormone that makes us sleep, and the moment the light goes away, like in the evening, that's when our peak melatonin [is produced].\"", "Are Melatonin Pills Really Safe?", "Since they aren't regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, it might be hard to tell if there are preservatives and additives in the pills you're taking, says Sanjeev Kothare, MD, a professor in the department of neurology and director of the pediatric sleep program at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"Some [users] have experienced a little bit of Since they aren't regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, it might be hard to tell if there are preservatives and additives in the pills you're taking, says Sanjeev Kothare, MD, a professor in the department of neurology and director of the pediatric sleep program at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"Some [users] have experienced a little bit of allergic reactions , not from the melatonin, but from the preservatives or additives,\" he says.

While these results haven't been replicated in humans, there also haven't been any good studies showing the long-term safety of melatonin pills, says Kothare.", "Still, Lee adds that no serious side effects have been reported. Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a Still, Lee adds that no serious side effects have been reported. Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a headache , or experience some short-term memory loss. \"Those are the common but pretty mild side effects,\" he says. The important thing, Lee points out, is to take the correct amount.", "\"The biggest myth out there, especially for \"The biggest myth out there, especially for insomnia , is that more is better,\" says Lee. In fact, when it comes to melatonin, less is actually more because your body already makes it. He suggests taking 0.5 milligrams if you do decide to try it. If that dosage amount is difficult to track down, buy 1 milligram pills and cut them in half.", "The bottom line: Unfortunately, there's not enough solid research out there on whether melatonin supplements are truly an effective and safe way to get to sleep. If you're still struggling to reach dreamland, Kothare has several other suggestions: Try to maintain a similar sleep schedule during the week and on weekends, limit the use of electronics that emit blue light for 1 to 2 hours before bedtime, and purchase a bright light source for use in the mornings to help regulate your body's internal clock.

That's why companies like Google and Microsoft let employees work from home or adjust their schedules to account for personal responsibilities, like taking a child to school in the morning.", "But the study suggests a downside: Your boss may be unconsciously judging you for giving yourself a later start time, regardless of how much work you're getting done.", "In the study, which will be published in full in the Journal of Applied Psychology later this year, researchers asked 149 supervisors to rate an employee’s performance; employee start times ranged from 5 a.m. to 9:45 a.m. Even when employees who started later in the day worked the same number of hours as those who started earlier, supervisors were inclined to rate employees who began work earlier as more conscientious, and gave them higher performance ratings.", "Bosses who preferred to work later hours themselves were less inclined to display this \"morning bias.\"", "In a second experiment, the researchers assigned a group of 141 college students the role of a supervisor, and asked each student to review a profile of a fictitious employee. The performance of the fictional employee was the same in all cases, but start time varied across profiles. Researchers found that employees who worked from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. were consistently given higher ratings of conscientiousness and performance by the student supervisors than employees who worked from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.", "The researchers concluded that employees who can opt for flexible work schedules should shift their schedules earlier, not later, to account for managers' morning bias.", "\"It seems likely that some employees are experiencing a decrement in their performance ratings that is not based on anything having to do with their actual performance,\" the three researchers wrote in a post for the Harvard Business Review.", "This \"morning bias\" appears to be deeply ingrained.

That Hanks, a two-time Best Actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in Paul Greengrass' new film should provide Oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actor's awards chances.", "\"Captain Phillips\" is set to open the 2013 New York Film Festival, but Sony and producer Scott Rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on Toronto. Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment's own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: \"Captain Phillips\" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and well ahead of Ben Affleck's Best Picture-winning \"Argo.\"", "The reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies. Yet as Greengrass keeps turning the screws on Phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. Hanks is put through the ringer -- Greengrass' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking. Like the best acting, Hanks' performance actually feels real. By the end of the film, it's hard to tell where Hanks ends and Phillips begins.", "This is the time of year when a new Oscar front-runner debuts almost every day (\"Gravity\" and \"12 Years A Slave\" reached the top of the line after raves last week). Yet \"Captain Phillips\" belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for Hanks and Greengrass (a previous nominee for \"United 93,\" a film that bears similarities to \"Captain Phillips\" in structure and form), but for Best Editing (Christopher Rouse), Best Cinematography (Barry Ackroyd), Best Adapted Screenplay (Billy Ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps Best Supporting Actor for Barkhad Abdi. The newcomer plays Muse, the lead Somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. Abdi (and Barkhad Addirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing Phillips' kidnappers, an easy pitfall that Greengrass deftly avoids.

It appears that this young scholar felt offended because a homily on love made him feel bad for not showing love! In his mind, the speaker was wrong for making him, and his peers, feel uncomfortable.", "I’m not making this up. Our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic! Any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims! Anyone who dares challenge them and, thus, makes them \"feel bad\" about themselves, is a \"hater,\" a \"bigot,\" an \"oppressor,\" and a \"victimizer.\"", "I have a message for this young man and all others who care to listen. That feeling of discomfort you have after listening to a sermon is called a conscience! An altar call is supposed to make you feel bad! It is supposed to make you feel guilty! The goal of many a good sermon is to get you to confess your sins — not coddle you in your selfishness. The primary objective of the Church and the Christian faith is your confession, not your self-actualization!", "So here’s my advice:", "If you want the chaplain to tell you you’re a victim rather than tell you that you need virtue, this may not be the university you’re looking for. If you want to complain about a sermon that makes you feel less than loving for not showing love, this might be the wrong place.", "If you’re more interested in playing the \"hater\" card than you are in confessing your own hate; if you want to arrogantly lecture, rather than humbly learn; if you don’t want to feel guilt in your soul when you are guilty of sin; if you want to be enabled rather than confronted, there are many universities across the land (in Missouri and elsewhere) that will give you exactly what you want, but Oklahoma Wesleyan isn’t one of them.", "At OKWU, we teach you to be selfless rather than self-centered. We are more interested in you practicing personal forgiveness than political revenge. We want you to model interpersonal reconciliation rather than foment personal conflict. We believe the content of your character is more important than the color of your skin. We don’t believe that you have been victimized every time you feel guilty and we don’t issue \"trigger warnings\" before altar calls.", "Oklahoma Wesleyan is not a \"safe place\", but rather, a place to learn: to learn that life isn’t about you, but about others; that the bad feeling you have while listening to a sermon is called guilt; that the way to address it is to repent of everything that’s wrong with you rather than blame others for everything that’s wrong with them.

He’s like Tim Tebow, but Wilson doesn’t look like he’s going back to baseball any time soon. At age 27 there is definitely more to come for the Seattle Seahawks quarterback. Not only does he have two Super Bowl appearances and a championship to his name, but he just earned another ring after tying the knot with Ciara.", "With the Seahawks in the middle of training camp and only three days away from their preseason opener against the Chiefs, we had a chance to chat with Wilson about a recent commercial he shot with Bose for their QuietComfort35 headphones. Over the phone, the three-time Pro Bowler and Super XLVIII Champion talked about his unusual—at least for your average NFL player’s standards—taste in music, the future of the Seattle Seahawks, and how married life is treating him.", "So what is this Bose commercial looking like?", "It’s gonna be a good commercial. I’m not giving away too much, I want people to see it first. Kinda can’t tell too much, but it was a great commercial. It’s so much fun shooting those commercials, especially with Bose. They’re very first class in everything they do, and I’m a big music person, as you know. I listen to tons of music, and we always have music playing around the house, Ciara and I, but also on the field, too. I have the wireless headphones in the locker room and the training room, and we listen to music when we’re watching film, all those things, so I’m constantly just listening to music. I think it can bring me a sense of peace and allows me to cancel out all the noise. I just like focusing on the things I need to focus on.", "You have one song to listen to before kickoff, what’re you listening to?", "That’s a great question. \"I’m Gonna Be Ready\" by Yolanda Adams . That’s probably my go-to song. Before a game, I’m always listening to gospel music. I’m just so grateful on game day. I don’t try to be all amped up. I try to be calm as can be and just grateful that I can play the game. It’s a special, special day, those days.", "So you’re not listening to Drake, Eminem, or anyone like that before kickoff?", "Nah, I’m chillin’ out.", "The NFL said they’re going to teach referees to call questionable catches incomplete if they aren’t 100 percent sure. You’ve been a part of questionable catches, how do you feel about what the NFL is trying to do?", "I think ultimately the NFL and all the players, we just want it to be called the right way, whatever that is. That’s the simplicity of it. It’s not that complicated. I think the biggest thing is, the referees, they always want to make the right call, and us as players, we always want them to make the right call as well.

I’m just so grateful on game day. I don’t try to be all amped up.", "In the last four years, you have faced a division rival in the playoffs. What’s it like to face a team in the division in the postseason?", "Our division, in my opinion, is one of the hardest divisions, for sure, the NFC West. So many talented players, so many talented teams. When you go against the 49ers twice a year, you go against the Rams twice a year, you go against the Arizona Cardinals twice a year, that’s not an easy conference, but we try to...the ultimate goal for us is to go 1-0 every week and to block out all the noise and to focus on one game in a week. That’s a big part of my philosophy, and our team philosophy is just to go 1-0 every week and just try to win that one game and see what happens.", "You were ranked 17th in the NFL Top 100. Where would you rank yourself, and what do you have to do to be ranked higher next year?", "That’s not for me to worry about. All I care about is our team winning; that’s the only thing that matters. The rest will handle itself. That’s my only focus, man. All that stuff like I said, I just try to block out all that noise, ignore the noise, and like I said, winning a game, and a big part of that is kind of my regimen—how I get ready for the offseason, how I get ready for a game, and the focus you put into all the hard work that you put into everything you do, and Bose definitely plays a part of that; my music plays a major part of that.", "What did you make of the Hall of Fame Game being canceled?", "I think it was the right decision in terms of players safety. It always comes down to players’ safety.", "There was the big blockbuster trade where you guys got Jimmy Graham last year. You guys were ranked low in tight end receptions, and Jimmy only had 48 catches in 11 games. How come his numbers went down?", "Unfortunately, he didn’t get to play the whole season. Kinda holds him back, but we always wanna get better, and we always wanna do more. So we’re looking forward to him being back out there on the field. He’s gonna do a great job.", "How much did Marshawn Lynch mean to this team and your play?", "Marshawn’s a great football player. He’s always gonna be well respected across the league. Now, guys gotta step up, and we can’t wait. We have a great team, we have a lot of great players. I’m excited about the running back group that we have stepping in. Those guys are gonna do a great job, and we’re looking forward to having a great season.", "Are you concerned the Legion of Boom won’t last much longer with more free agency talks and contracts coming up for them?", "I think the Legion of Boom is going to be great once again. I’m excited about all the things that they’re gonna do this year. Our team, just in general, our offense and defense and special teams—you take it one day at a time.", "Congratulations on the marriage, how is the married life?", "It’s a blessing man, to find someone so special, so sweet. She’s one of the best people you can ever meet, one of the best moms you can ever meet. I’m just grateful for that.", "Your celebrity has reached new heights. From third-round pick out of college to a couple Super Bowl appearances as the quarterback of one of the best teams in the league—so what is the craziest headline you have ever heard about yourself?", "Awh man, I don’t pay attention to any of that stuff. I’m just grateful I get to play the game of football.

Guess who is."], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["L ast year, ast year, Tesco’s food waste mountain amounted to 59,400 tonnes . If you’re finding that figure hard to envisage, it’s the equivalent of 119m meals, and an increase of 4% on the year before. From this we can deduce that Tesco’s voluble commitment to reducing its edible detritus has yet to yield results. But is Tesco any worse in this respect than any other supermarket chain? Probably wisely, the others don’t publish their waste figures, but let’s just assume that if they had a better story to tell us, we’d already know all about it.", "Tesco’s waste tally is certainly grotesque, but PR executives expert in techniques for smoothing over corporate difficulties would doubtless applaud the masterly way Tesco deflected criticism. On the day that his chain’s depressing results were published, chief executive Dave Lewis addressed a food industry summit where he exhorted food manufacturers to do more to reduce their waste across the supply chain.", "After deftly passing the waste ball back to his supply base, Lewis reprised a favourite supermarket refrain: blame the consumer. \"While the majority of food waste arises from the home, industry recognises the need to lead by example.\" There you have the dramatis personae in Tesco’s food waste script: profligate consumers, suppliers who earn a \"must work harder\" rating, and enlightened Tesco, leading the vanguard in the national war on waste.", "Just in case you aren’t finding the plot line 100% credible, a further emotional strand is woven in: Tesco promises to redistribute all its unsold edible food to charities from 2017. Putting a gloss on your waste problem by repackaging it as a food poverty solution is a tactic increasingly deployed by our major supermarkets. Ideally, from a supermarket PR point of view, the term \"food poverty\" would appear in every headline that contains \"supermarket food waste\", for that allows our giant retailers to bask in the role of philanthropists who use their corporate might for the common good. It places a halo of saintliness around all their business activities.", "But a waste prevention strategy should never be confused with a poverty reduction strategy. Crumbs from the rich man’s table is a shallow, and too easily self-aggrandising response to the unacceptable reality that millions of fellow citizens can’t afford to eat good, fresh food. What’s more, the red herring of food poverty draws attention further away from one essential fact about supermarkets we must digest if we are ever to make any progress: waste is hard-wired into the supermarket system.", "When the supermarkets began colonising the UK grocery market in the early 1980s, they appeared to be a newer, more efficient way of feeding the nation. They promised vast economies of scale by virtue of their collective buying power and state-of-the-art distribution logistics that would bring every agricultural product on the planet to our shelves, 365 days a year. This precision shopping model, we were assured, would produce dividends for consumers in the form of lower prices and more convenient shopping. Who needs parades of small, independent shops when chains can feed us so much more efficiently, and for less?", "Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese; now we live in dread of food poisoning", "Four decades on, it’s becoming obvious that supermarkets are incapable of delivering this promise. Why? They are retail dinosaurs, locked into a system that’s riddled with problems.", "One such glaring issue is food waste. Far from discouraging it, the supermarket business model actively begets it.", "There aren’t, to my knowledge, any robust statistics on levels of food waste in British households before the supermarket era, but I’d hazard a guess that they were much lower than they are now.", "Our rubbish bins really started filling up when, instead of shopping for a little, as was needed, every day or two, we were persuaded to adopt the one-stop supermarket shopping trip. Theoretically, armed with a list, we could buy all the food we needed for a week. Nowadays, supermarket online ordering makes that even easier to do. Just press the same-as-last-week option. So supermarkets egg us on to overlook what we already have and to buy much more than we need. They encourage us to hazard a weekly guess about what we’ll consume, rather than focusing on what’s in our fridges and larders day-to-day.", "If the untouched remnants of last week’s order are stacking up in the fridge when the supermarket van arrives at our door, most people will consign them to the bin, schooled to believe, thanks to supermarket use by and best before dates, that judging freshness is best left to distant experts. Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese, now we live in dread of poisoning. Better safe than sorry, surely?", "But sell-by dates – the progenitor of use by and best before – were introduced by supermarkets as stock rotation tools, to help clunky, mammoth chains keep tabs on the unprecedented amount of product passing through their system, not primarily as safeguards against food poisoning.", "Undoubtedly, certain foods sold by supermarkets do pose a very real risk to health. Around two thirds of their raw chickens are contaminated with potentially lethal campylobacter at the point of sale, even though they are well within their use-by dates. Yet again supermarkets point the finger of blame at the stupid, sloppy home cook who fails to slay the bacteria through thorough cooking, rather than eradicating infection at their factory farms.", "And don’t forget that supermarkets have actively undermined our national food handling experience and skill by telling us that we’re too \"time poor\" to cook from scratch, largely because it is much more profitable for them to sell us value-added, processed foods whose apparent freshness is validated by reassuring dates.

The company has been growing since 2007 and now claims over 750,000 users. inFlow has a free option that limits you to 100 products and customers, and a baker’s dozen reports. You also miss out on some advanced user features and inventory management options.", "The free version has no expiration, though, and small businesses will be well-served by the small set of options. Default features include barcoding, different accounting methods, and automatic data backup, among others.", "Once you outgrow the free version, inFlow can be upgraded for a one-off, $399 payment. That will unlock unlimited products and customers, more reports, and advanced features like customized invoices and order forms. Paying customers also get a year of support.", "Carta is the online offering from the people who brought you inFlow. Carta also offers a slimmed down free version. Carta’s limitations are based on the number of sales per month that can be processed — at the free level, it’s a mere 10.", "Luckily, every level is currently free since Carta is still in its beta testing phase. You might have a few hiccups along the way, but you can get the $99 per month package for free, right now. The company anticipates the free betas running through the end of 2015, so you’ll have plenty of time to figure out which package works for you.", "Carta includes some interesting options for collaboration with buyers and sellers, so you can assist folks through the ordering process. With the background from inFlow, Carta should offer you everything a small business needs.", "Rightcontrol Lite provides inventory management for ten product lines.

Apart from a limitation on product lines, the Lite flavor offers all the features of its bigger sisters and brothers in the Rightcontrol line.", "Users can set automatic reorder reminders when stock gets low, can print labels for stock, and can integrate with a barcode system. If you need more than the ten products or want more users, growing businesses can upgrade to Rightcontol Solo, Pro, or Workgroup for about $1.50, $7.50, or $30 per month — the company’s rates are given in British Pounds.

As of this writing, The Shawshank Redemption is sitting atop the IMDB rankings of the most popular movies of all-time. The film is truly beloved today. However, that wasn’t always the case. While the film was critically praised upon its release, it was a commercial failure. Nobody saw it in the theaters, and most fans found it on home video or cable later.

Shawshank, the name of the prison where the film takes place, is a meaningless word by itself. Morgan Freeman jokes in the interview that many people would mispronounce the word, even while telling him how much they loved the movie.Hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint.

Morgan Freeman makes a good point, that by doing the title his way, the part that you see has Rita Hayworth’s name, which is something, although it’s possible the studio was afraid people would think the theater was showing old movies.While we’ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for The Shawshank Redemption we do know that the title they chose didn’t help.

Iulian Valentin/Shutterstock", "If processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. Surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate.", "\"We propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system,\" write graduate student Erica Schulte and Dr. Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan in PLOS ONE", "The authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as \"loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so.\" They back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist.", "\"Although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating,\" the authors write.", "To test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the Yale Food Addiction Scale , of which Gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors.", "Unsurprisingly, foods dense in fat and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by how swiftly it is converted to sugar) topped the scale. As the authors note, drinks with higher concentrations of alcohol are more addictive than their more diffuse counterparts. The finding is also consistent with animal studies, which highlight the role of dopamine, our brain's \"pleasure chemical\" that's often implicated in addiction. For instance, rats fed a diet consisting of highly processed foods showed changes to the brain's dopamine system that's also seen in response to illicit drugs.", "The respondents were segmented in order to explore how gender and body mass index (BMI) alter the difficulty to resist particular food components. Gender was not found to be relevant; people with high BMIs reported addictive-like attraction to more foods, although the correlation was not as strong as might be expected.", "Chocolate came up most often, followed by ice cream and french fries.", "However, the authors were not convinced they had solved the question of which food is the most craving-inducing. A further 384 people were asked online to rate the addictiveness of each food on a scale of 1 to 7. Using this larger (and more representative) sample, the clear winner was pizza, with a mean score of 4.01, followed by chocolate and chips sharing second at 3.73. Several other foods – all highly processed and rich in sugar, fat or both – were tightly bunched behind. At the bottom of the addictiveness scale came cucumber, carrots and beans. Even water ranked higher than these.", "Strangely, however, while the study included soda and water, coffee was not offered among the 35 choices. A match-up between caffeine and pizza’s salt/sugar/fat will have to wait for another time."], "targetTitle": "According To Science, This Is The Most Addictive Food In The World", "targetDescription":

Try to keep Stella in the yard.\"", "At this point, a large dog -- presumably Stella -- bounds into view, runs to one end of the fence and jumps right over it, almost without effort. There is a perfectly timed comedic pause, then the man says, \"Dammit.\"", "In the comments section of the video, the original poster explains why he thought the fence would be high enough to contain Stella: \"Before I made the fence, I had Stella jump a baby gate inside and when she stopped jumping it I added six inches (15.2 centimeters).\" In a classic 'blame the dog' moment he adds, \"She set me up!\"", "What did the man eventually do with the useless fence?

According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who's been married before. In 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said \"I do.\"", "\"There's so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general,\" Gretchen Livingston, Senior Researcher at Pew and author of the study, told The Huffington Post. \"I was really curious to juxtapose that with what's going on with remarriage.\"", "Livingston analyzed data from the 2013 American Community Survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the US has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960. But not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent Pew survey about marriage, Livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others.", "Among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry.", "There are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to Livingston. For one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, \"eligible\" to remarry has also risen. (But it's worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since.)", "The more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers. While only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013.", "\"The older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried,\" Livingston said.", "Younger Americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013. It's very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasn't soured on the institution of marriage completely, however. Livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two.", "Overall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again.", "Age wasn't the only differentiating factor, though. When Pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again. There was a clear gender divide: Divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position.", "A majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it. In comparison, 43 percent of women said they'd be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didn't want to ever marry again. Only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle.", "Previous studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do. Livingston said it's quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts.", "Another interesting finding combined both age and gender: In remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife. This age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples. If you consider that 39 percent of first-time newlyweds (and 21 percent of remarried couples) are within a year of each other's ages, this age gap among remarried couples becomes particularly noteworthy.", "But don't make too many assumptions about newlyweds -- it's a demographic that's still in flux.", "While today's divorce rate might make newlyweds of the 1960s cringe, that doesn't mean that today's society has lost faith in marriage. In fact, according to Pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960. Taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the American family.", "\"Maybe newlyweds don't look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late '60s,\" Livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of today's newlywed couples involve at least one person who's been married before. \"But I think it's very striking and just another example of how the definitions of family and the norm are changing.\""], "targetTitle": "Pew Report Reveals Who's Likely To Get Married More Than Once", "targetDescription": "Good news for romantics: The divorce rate may be disma...", "targetKeywords": "starter marriage,starter marriages,second marriage,second marriages,second marriage statistics,marriage statistics,starter marriage statistics", "targetMedia": ["http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2322978/images/n-ELIZABETH-TAYLOR-HILTON-628x314.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2322978/images/o-ELIZABETH-TAYLOR-HILTON-facebook.jpg", "http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/229666/slide_229666_1039035_free.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2014/11/ST_2014-11-14_remarriage-07.png", "http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2014/11/ST_2014-11-14_remarriage-04.png", "http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2014/11/ST_2014-11-14_remarriage-02.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "targetUrl": "http://huff.to/1rqzkUw", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Divorced people", "spoilerPublisher": "HuffPoSpoilers"}, "spoiler": ["According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who's been married before."], "spoilerPositions": [[[0, 88], [0, 213]]], "tags": ["passage"]}

On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. I called myself \"big mama\", because I knew I’d be the oldest one there. I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college.", "The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. I still don’t have words for that feeling. In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence.", "Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair.

My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. To calm me down, they said it’s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions.", "After a few hours of this, they let me shower. I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don’t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn’t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.", "On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don’t always show up immediately.

They gave me huge hugs, and then I walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes.", "My sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I’m right here, I’m okay, everything’s okay, I’m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P.E. teacher, let’s go home, let’s eat something. She did not know that beneath my sweats, I had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours my sister held me.", "My boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, \"I was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?\" I was horrified. That’s when I learned I had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister. Again, he asked me, \"What happened last night? Did you make it home okay?\" I said yes, and hung up to cry.", "I was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, I may have been raped behind a dumpster, but I don’t know by who or when or how. If I told them, I would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead I pretended the whole thing wasn’t real.", "I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone. After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream. I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone, and I became isolated from the ones I loved most. For one week after the incident, I didn’t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. The only symbol that proved that it hadn’t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer.", "One day, I was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. In it, I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize. This was how I learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. That’s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn’t fall from a tree. He had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. I don’t even know this person. I still don’t know this person. When I read about me like this, I said, this can’t be me.", "This can’t be me. I could not digest or accept any of this information. I could not imagine my family having to read about this online. I kept reading. In the next paragraph, I read something that I will never forgive; I read that according to him, I liked it. I liked it. Again, I do not have words for these feelings.", "At the bottom of the article, after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. She was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. By the way, he’s really good at swimming. Throw in my mile time if that’s what we’re doing. I’m good at cooking, put that in there, I think the end is where you list your extra-curriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that’ve happened.", "The night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it’s upsetting, just know that I’m okay, I’m right here, and I’m okay. But halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up. I was not okay.", "The night after it happened, he said he didn’t know my name, said he wouldn’t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn’t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. Dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn’t know. He admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. Sometimes I think, if I hadn’t gone, then this never would’ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue.", "The night after it happened, he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back. A back rub. Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us speaking, a back rub.", "One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don’t remember, so how do I prove I didn’t like it.", "I thought there’s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He’s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused.", "I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn’t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation.", "When I was told to be prepared in case we didn’t win, I said, I can’t prepare for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. Worst of all, I was warned, because he now knows you don’t remember, he is going to get to write the script. He can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. I had no power, I had no voice, I was defenseless. My memory loss would be used against me. My testimony was weak, was incomplete, and I was made to believe that perhaps, I am not enough to win this. That’s so damaging. His attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is Brock, because she doesn’t remember. That helplessness was traumatizing.", "Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney’s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. Instead of his attorney saying, Did you notice any abrasions? He said, You didn’t notice any abrasions, right? This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth. The sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering question like:", "How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner? Did you drink with dinner? No, not even water? When did you drink? How much did you drink? What container did you drink out of? Who gave you the drink? How much do you usually drink? Who dropped you off at this party? At what time? But where exactly? What were you wearing? Why were you going to this party? What’d you do when you got there? Are you sure you did that? But what time did you do that? What does this text mean? Who were you texting? When did you urinate? Where did you urinate? With whom did you urinate outside? Was your phone on silent when your sister called? Do you remember silencing it? Really because on page 53 I’d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. Did you drink in college? You said you were a party animal? How many times did you black out? Did you party at frats? Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay, we’ll let Brock fill it in.", "I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn’t even take the time to ask me for my name, who had me naked a handful of minutes after seeing me. After a physical assault, I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don’t line up, she’s out of her mind, she’s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he’s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, Brock has a lot at stake so he’s having a really hard time right now.", "And then it came time for him to testify. This is where I became revictimized. I want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didn’t know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasn’t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember.", "So one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so.", "He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He’d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don’t ask, Can I finger you? Usually there’s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He’s in the clear.", "Even in this story, there’s barely any dialogue; I only said a total of three words before he had me half naked on the ground. I have never been penetrated after three words. He didn’t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night, so in the news when it says we \"met\", I’m not sure I would go so far as to say that. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn’t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. If she can’t do that, then no. Don’t touch her, just no. Not maybe, just no. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.", "According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don’t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that’s why she wore the cardigan. If her bare ass and legs are rubbing the pinecones and needles, while the weight of you pushes into her, get off her.", "Next in the story, two people approached you. You ran because you said you felt scared. I argue that you were scared because you’d be caught, not because you were scared of two terrifying Swedish grad students. The idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue was ludicrous. That it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body. You were caught red handed, with no explanation. When they tackled you why didn’t [you] say, \"Stop! Everything’s okay, go ask her, she’s right over there, she’ll tell you.\" I mean you had just asked for my consent, right? I was awake, right? When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn’t speak because of what he’d seen. Also, if you really did think they were dangerous, you just abandoned a half-naked girl to run and save yourself. No matter which way you frame it, it doesn’t make sense.", "Your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don’t know exactly when she became unconscious. And you’re right, maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasn’t completely limp yet, fine. His guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that I became unconscious, that is never what this was about. I was slurring, too drunk to consent way before I was on the ground. I should have never been touched in the first place. Brock stated, \"At no time did I see that she was not responding. If at any time I thought she was not responding, I would have stopped immediately.\" Here’s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when I was literally unresponsive, then you still do not understand. You didn’t even stop when I was unconscious anyway! Someone else stopped you. Two guys on bikes noticed I wasn’t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. How did you not notice while on top of me?", "You said, you would have stopped and gotten help. You say that, but I want you to explain how you would’ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. I want to know, if those evil Swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. I am asking you; Would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? Untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? Closed my legs, covered me? Tucked my bra back into my dress? Would you have helped me pick the needles from my hair? Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? Would you then go find a friend and say, Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? I don’t sleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the Swedes had never come. What would have happened to me? That’s what you’ll never have a good answer for, that’s what you can’t explain even after a year.", "To sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes I wanted it, yes I permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick, is demented, is selfish, is stupid. It shows that you were willing to go to any length, to discredit me, invalidate me, and explain why it was okay to hurt me. You tried unyieldingly to save yourself, your reputation, at my expense.", "My family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, dress hiked up, limbs limp in the dark. And then even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say, the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. To say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, but that’s what happens when you finger someone, and he’s already admitted to that. To listen to him use my own sister against me. To listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me, the seductive party animal, as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me. To listen to him say I sounded drunk on the phone because I’m silly and that’s my goofy way of speaking. To point out that in the voicemail, I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking. I assure you my rewards program is non-transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me.", "The point is, this is everything my family and I endured during the trial. This is everything I had to sit through silently, taking it, while he shaped the evening. It is enough to be suffering. It is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering. But in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney’s twisted logic fooled no one. The truth won, the truth spoke for itself.", "You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that’s twelve votes per count, thirty-six yeses confirming guilt, that’s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. And I thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. Then I read your statement.", "If you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die, I’m almost there. You are very close. Assault is not an accident. This is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making. Somehow, you still don’t get it. Somehow, you still sound confused.", "I will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendant’s statement and respond to them.", "You said, Being drunk I just couldn’t make the best decisions and neither could she.", "Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That’s the difference.", "You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room.", "I’m not mad because you didn’t ask for my number. Even if you did know me, I would not want [to] be in this situation. My own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this situation. Nobody. I don’t care if you know their phone number or not.", "You said, I stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. I was wrong.", "Again, you were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and own my sister could not find me. Sipping fireball is not your crime. Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. Why am I still explaining this.", "You said, During the trial I didn’t want to victimize her at all. That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case.", "Your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. Did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? Absolutely. He said you had an erection, because it was cold. I have no words.", "You said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to \"speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that.\"", "Speak out against campus drinking culture. That’s what we’re speaking out against? You think that’s what I’ve spent the past year fighting for? Not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. Campus drinking culture. Down with Jack Daniels. Down with Skyy Vodka. If you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an AA meeting. You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? Show men how to respect women, not how to drink less.", "Drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. Where does promiscuity even come into play? I don’t see headlines that read, Brock Turner, Guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Campus [Sexual] Assault. There’s your first powerpoint slide.", "I have done enough explaining. You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You do not get to not know why you ran. You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct.", "Lastly you said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life.", "Ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.", "See one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. I am no stranger to suffering. You made me a victim. In newspapers my name was \"unconscious intoxicated woman\", ten syllables, and nothing more than that. For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All-American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, who waited a year to figure out if I was worth something.", "My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. I became closed off, angry, self-deprecating, tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before that night either. While you worry about your shattered reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you, the pain became so bad that I had to tell my boss I was leaving, I needed time because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my savings to go as far away as I could possibly be.", "I can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. For three months, I went to bed at six o’clock in the morning.", "I used to pride myself on my independence, now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being. I have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone’s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry.", "You have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. It took me eight months to even talk about what happened. I could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. I would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. You never let me forget what happened to me. At the of end of the hearing, the trial, I was too tired to speak. I would leave drained, silent. I would go home turn off my phone and for days I would not speak. You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself. Every time a new article [would] come out, I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. I didn’t want anyone’s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be.", "Someday, you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy. But you cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I’m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight from stress, when people would comment I told them I’ve been running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak.", "I want to say this. All the crying, the hurting you have imposed on me, I can take it. But when I see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then I do not forgive you. That night I had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. Your attorney’s closing statement began, \"My sister said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister.\" You tried to use my own sister against me. Your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. You do not touch her.", "If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering.", "You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on.", "Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. Right now your name is tainted, so I challenge you to make a new name for yourself, to do something so good for the world, it blows everyone away. You have a brain and a voice and a heart. Use them wisely. You possess immense love from your family. That alone can pull you out of anything. Mine has held me up through all of this. Yours will hold you and you will go on.", "I believe, that one day, you will understand all of this better. I hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again. I fully support your journey to healing, to rebuilding your life, because that is the only way you’ll begin to help others.", "Now to address the sentencing. When I read the probation officer’s report, I was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. My statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system. The context is also important. Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks.", "My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured. Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice.", "I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison. I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. The probation officer’s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time-out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain I have been forced to endure. I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing.", "Unfortunately, after reading the defendant’s statement, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity. By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can’t even see that distinction.", "The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. He is young, but he is old enough to know better.", "As this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone’s first sexual assault or digital rape. It doesn’t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative. The fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class.", "The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. If I had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? How fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me.", "The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication. It felt serious. That’s all I’m going to say.", "He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn’t expire. Just like what he did to me doesn’t expire, doesn’t just go away after a set number of years. It stays with me, it’s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life.", "A year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands. Has he been seeing a psychologist? What has he done in this past year to show he’s been progressing? If he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it?", "Throughout incarceration I hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life. I request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault. I hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person.", "To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me.", "Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget.", "And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining.

This can help to reduce any environmental impact from production, use, and disposal of the bag.\"", "It furthered that the bag container material can be suitably used for many times even after slight tearing.

However, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you have to. The development team wants players of the new game to be abler to make their own decision as to how to play the game. This has apparently worked out so well that there's one major mechanic in the game you don't ever need to touch. I had a chance to sit down with both Watch Dogs 2 as well as the game's creative director where I learned that it's possible to beat Watch Dogs 2 without ever firing a gun. Something interesting is our LV Director, he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic...He used takedowns because sometimes in stealth you have to use them, but he never shot anyone. This is kind of our goal. You don't have to kill people and you don't have to shoot. Can we achieve that? Sometimes it's very difficult in a certain context, but we did it, so I'm super proud of that actually. The great appeal of open world games is that they're supposed to give you a variety of ways to attack any objective. However, quite often those same games tend to push you down a particular path, so one game mechanic is important in one mission and another is the focus later on. Ubisoft has tried to design Watch Dogs 2 so that players have more control. Jonathan Morin, the Creative Director of Watch Dogs 2 told me that while playing the game without guns isn't easy, it is possible. Instead, there are greater opportunities for using hacking in order to reach your goal. Every hackable object can be hacked in different ways, rather than just one, meaning that you have more control over how your environment reacts to you. The addition of rovers and drones also means that the player can get access to more areas without actually having to step foot in a place where you might be spotted. As a fan of the hacking aspect of the original Watch Dogs but not so much the Grand Theft Auto style gunplay, this more wide open world sounds much more interesting. I found myself far too often needing to fight off waves of enemies with a gun in the first game when I would much rather stun them with a hackable object before they even knew I was there. While my hands-on time with Watch Dogs 2 was limited, I can say I also never used a gun. Christopher Morin told me to \"think like a hacker\" while playing Watch Dogs 2, to consider how you can use the systems to solve the problems that you're dealing with. It gives the impression that the hacking aspect of the game has been set up more like a puzzle where the player will need to figure out how to hack the different parts of the game in order to solve it. However, the most important part of making that work is that you have to believe there is a solution. Based on the fact that you can apparently beat the game using only hacks and takedowns, it would appear the solution is possible. Will you try to beat Watch Dogs 2 without using a gun?

Mounting evidence has linked an unhealthy gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes.", "This new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy, Cedernaes explained. ", "The researchers followed nine individuals who spent two nights sleeping in a lab for eight and a half hours, and then another two nights of sleeping in a lab for only four and a half hours.", "The study included a fairly small number of people, but the strength behind the data is that the researchers were able to compare the effects of varied sleep levels on gut bacteria within the same individuals. Plus, they only included subjects who reported having gotten consistent sleep and regularly timed meals the week before the study, which meant everyone’s gut bacteria started out at a somewhat typical level.", "The data showed that getting less sleep didn’t necessarily change which gut bacteria the individuals had. But getting less sleep did change the levels of specific strains of bacteria. The amount of certain types of bacteria decreased by nearly 50 percent ― and that was after only two nights of not getting enough sleep.", "The finding was significant because the wrong balance of bacteria in our gut is thought to be one of the big factors that cause obesity in some individuals, Cedernaes explained. ", "What’s more, the ratios of specific strands of gut bacteria observed after individuals had not gotten a full night’s sleep mirrored the levels of the same gut bacteria previously observed in people who were obese or had other metabolic diseases.", "\"Gut bacteria are a crucial, natural component of our bodies,\" Cedernaes said. \"[They] break down fibers that we cannot digest otherwise. They can also help us extract nutrients.\" ", "There was yet another interesting finding from the study. The individuals were 20 percent less sensitive to the effects of insulin after having less sleep ― a potential diabetes risk ― compared to the days after the nights they had slept longer. ", "Sleep loss has been linked to decreased insulin sensitivity in previous studies, Cedernaes said. And while his new research did not necessarily suggest the effect was a result of the gut bacteria changes, the link is still an important observation because over time, constant insulin insensitivity is a well-established driver of diabetes. ", "Additional, longer studies will be necessary to prove that the gut bacteria changes observed after a few nights of insufficient sleep are linked with the various metabolic diseases thought to be connected to chronic sleep loss, like obesity, diabetes and heart disease.

It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon.", "Finding a Dark Moon", "Until this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake’s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake’s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake’s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The \"dark moon hypothesis\" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. \"Imagine that the dark material isn’t on Makemake’s surface... it’s in orbit!\" image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. \"If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!\"", "Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake’s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden.", "MK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don’t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker’s words, \"not actually that faint\"), but it was easy to miss before.", "Part of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake’s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he", "thought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, \"Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?\" When Buie replied, \"There’s a moon in the Makemake data?\" they knew they’d made a major discovery.", "The Moon in the Data", "It is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2’s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake’s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place.", "However, MK2’s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake’s past atmosphere. If MK2’s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, \"The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.\" If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts.", "The New, Improved Makemake System", "While MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, \"The discovery of this moon has given us an", "opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.\" ", "Makemake is sometimes referred to as \"Pluto’s little sister\" because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. \"That's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,\" Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake.", "Looking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system’s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech’s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, \"The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there.

What if China is transitioning too early? That's what HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Jing Li have posited in a recent note, \"China's new challenge: Faster services expansion, slower productivity growth.\"", "From the note (emphasis added):", "\"Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. It blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy's potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies.", "\"Based on the experience of some Latin American countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries.", "\"This kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth. Given that China's GDP per capita is only 14% that of the US, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth.\"", "Work, work, work, work, work", "What really worries HSBC is that the service sector's jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. The bank's analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter.", "HSBC", "Arguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the Chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project — if not in deed, then certainly in word. The reason for that is simple: debt.", "China has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 280%. Most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. In 2009, when the world was falling apart, the Chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam.", "That, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in Chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors.", "So, to combat that overcapacity, China would like to have fewer people working the jobs where they're making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of.", "The rest of the world would love that, too. Last week, the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the Chinese economy , \"Evaluating the Financial Risks of China,\" and much of it focused on what that country's economic slowdown has done to the American steel industry.", "During the hearing, Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s. He also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the Chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of. In reality, 300 million tons had been added to China's steel output.", "So what Gibson would like is for China to slow its production and wind the steel industry down.", "The problem with this solution, says HSBC, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that China won't grow as fast — not just in the short term, but also in the long term.", "From the note (emphasis added):", "\"The efficiency loss during such a 'rebalancing' can be huge. Between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics). Based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated RMB45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors. Therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, China's total output in 2015 could have been RMB225bn higher, which is around 0.3% of annual GDP.\"", "HSBC suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. But, to be honest, the Chinese government hasn't shown that kind of subtlety. Even now, banks continue to lend to unproductive corporations in order to keep workers employed and avoid a hard landing in the short term.", "Meanwhile, the transition to the service sector continues.", "Pretty controversial ideas, no?"], "targetTitle": "China is too quick to rebalance its services sector", "targetDescription": "China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers.

Sanders will argue that he is the strongest candidate to face Donald Trump in November.

But they weren't.", "It was invading texts, instant messages, email and even in-person dialogue. The slash was being vocalized where it might otherwise appear in written form, integrated smoothly into audible discussion. Since we aren't yet giving other punctuation the same treatment (\"Hello exclamation point\" still sounds odd), it didn't make much sense.", "After so much time being delegated to such boring utilitarian functions as dates (\"8/30/2014\") and fractions (\"3/4 cup\"), the humble slash mark seems to be getting a linguistic makeover. Anne Curzan, professor of English at the University of Michigan, described the practice among students in her classroom last year. Since then, Curzan told me in an email, she's been studying examples of slash usage on Twitter. The most common use corresponds most closely to \"and/or,\" but she said a fair number are \"used to connect one idea to another, perhaps meaning something like 'following up' or as something like a spoken semi-colon.\" Still, other examples use the slash as a way to indicate \"truth values for the elements it connects,\" Curzan explained. In other words, saying one thing when what you really mean is the next. Like saying you need to rest when what you're really planning is binge-watching TV.", "Grammatically speaking, outside of its role as punctuation, the slash also functions as a \"coordinator.\" Coordinators, also called coordinating conjunctions, include \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or\" and other words that function to link independent and dependent clauses.", "English speakers are pretty comfortable with this idea, as Geoffrey K. Pullum, professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, explained on his blog back in 2010. For example, we might invite our friend/roommate to go see \"Boyhood\" while planning to stuff our purse/backpack/pockets with cheap candy. Our meaning is clear. The person with whom we share a responsibility for rent is also our friend, and whatever discreet container we bring to the theater will help us avoid paying five dollars for a box of Sour Patch Kids. The slash helps us present alternative descriptions. Pullum suggested, however, that it really only makes sense in \"lexical rather than phrasal categories.\"", "\"With clauses,\" he wrote, \"I think there is no possibility of using it at all: consider 'I think I'm having hallucinations slash someone is playing tricks on me.' Doesn't seem like English at all, does it?\" These days, many English speakers would disagree. Curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clauses.", "\"The most interesting implication to me,\" she said, \"is that this coordinator is expanding in use ... and taking on new meanings.\"", "Usage guidelines are, of course, still very restrictive in formal writing. When the style guides and writers' handbooks I consulted mentioned the slash at all, they called it \"rarely necessary.\" A 1977 edition of Theodore Bernstein's \"The Careful Writer\" referred to the simple \"and/or\" as \"a visual and mental monstrosity that should be avoided.\"", "Tell that to anyone who considers themselves a \"slash DJ,\" to indicate their interest in the turntable arts outside of a regular nine-to-five. (Writer-slash-DJ. Financial-consultant-slash-DJ. Animal-whisperer-slash-DJ.) Or to Jezebel editor Kara Brown, who described Robin Thicke's \"Paula\" as the singer's \"most recent album slash lame ass attempt at gaining publicity saving his marriage.\"", "While it'd be difficult to pin down exactly why we started going slash-crazy, it sure seems to correspond nicely with our culture of digital communication. Abbreviated by a lack of time or screen space or both, our technology has allowed instant messaging to flourish, so we might make our always-important thoughts known as quickly as possible.", "The slash works as a stand-in, whether written or spoken, helping the writer express multiple ideas without going through the trouble of stringing them together using appropriate grammar, or else risking a series of awkwardly short bullet-point sentences. However strange \"I'm going for a run slash walk in the park\" sounds to your ear, it gets across the same basic message as the much wordier alternative, \"I'm going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking, too, because running is hard.\" Using \"slash\" assigned more \"truth value\" to \"walk\" over \"run.\" The slash gives us a perfect opportunity to say two or more things at once like this, especially if one or more of those things is our own unsolicited snarky commentary. (\"Friendship slash rivalry.\" \"Review slash indictment.\")", "In digital scenarios where time is of the essence, it might seem counterintuitive that typing \"slash\" in the written form would so often take the place of the shorter and equally comprehensible \"and\" or \"or\" if convenience is such a concern. So maybe it speaks, then, to our comfort with digital communication tools like keyboards and touch screens. Typing is second nature to us, and the slash is an almost mindlessly simple way to link our related thoughts. It's a match made in, um, some factory in China.", "Breakfast slash lunch! Yum! @ Max's Restaurant, SM Mall of Asia http://t.co/oSSwgVkLA4 — Uriel Yu Medellin (@itsmeuriel) August 4, 2014", "But will it stick around?", "We can't say. To certain linguists, though, change is actually a great sign. Change means that people are using a language, and using a language keeps it healthy. (There's not a lot of new slang being formed, for example, in Latin.) But everyone owns the English language -- or, maybe, no one does -- and we're not that great at sharing. If it is, in fact, here to stay, some grammar-sticklers will undoubtedly be scandalized at the prospect of a new coordinator, which Curzan called \"a category of words that doesn't often show much creativity and/or admit new members.\"", "Correction: This story has been amended to reflect the correct spelling of Geoffrey K.

One memorable shot showed off the singer's protruding package in arresting profile. Shortly after the photos hit the Internet, a web site called Breathe Heavy posted what it claimed was the same image prior to re-touching. If that claim were accurate, it would mean that Calvin Klein (well, not him personally, although maybe) had stuffed Bieber's stocking nearly to bursting. Here are the two images side-by-side:", "Bieber's team immediately insisted that Breathe Heavy's photo was fake, and requested the web site take it down. Breathe Heavy complied, originally replacing the photos with an editor's note, but eventually removing the entire post altogether. In that since-deleted note, Breathe Heavy's editor seems to accept Bieber's explanation at gunpoint.", "Bieber denies the photo is real, and I respect that and will believe him.", "The question, therefore, is: Are the claims of the Bieber camp correct, and the photo fake?", "Or did Breathe Heavy have the real photo, and capitulate in the face of legal intimidation?", "(It's easy to make a case that Breathe Heavy's photos are the real deal: We know that at least one photo was significantly retouched prior to publication, as Bieber's camp did not dispute an earlier TMZ story alleging that Calvin Klein sculpted Bieber's pecs, filled out his abs and bestowed him pubes in this ad from the campaign; furthermore, virtually every celebrity photoshoot in America gets touched up at some point. Why would Bieber's dick be a grand outlier?)", "But in many ways this dispute is just a lead-in to an essential American question: What exactly is Bieber packing?", "Let's be true detectives.", "This is a screencap taken from a video of the Calvin Klein shoot that Bieber himself posted to Instagram. Here we have a direct, unaltered view of his package and can plainly see that it looks quite different than the massive knot he is sporting in the photo advertisement. Front-bulge will almost always look less impressive than side-bluge, granted, and this is a fine bulge, certainly, but one that seems far off of Calvin Klein's idealized Burmese python.", "Last September, Bieber appeared onstage at the Fashion Rocks concert. For some reason he stripped down to his underwear, which produced a number of generally alarming photos such as this one.", "There are a number of things we can glean from this photo. One is that Justin Bieber has muscles. Look at the strong boy! Another is that his happy trail does indeed appear to stop abruptly right about where it does in the pre-Photoshop version of the Calvin Klein shot in which a model gropes him. But because Bieber wore jet black briefs that reveal no hint of bulge, this photo doesn't help us understand how big his dick actually is.", "For that, we must consult more candid shots.", "In 2013, Bieber went to Hawaii and jumped off a cliff. After exiting the water, he was photographed walking on the beach, resulting in the image you see here:", "This is perhaps the most revealing shot of Bieber's bulge in the wild. Does it look exceedingly large? I'd say not. In fact, it looks like any man's normal penis. Of course, it should be noted that it's unfair to judge a dick by what it looks like immediately after being submerged in the sea. However we can only work with the materials we have.", "Next we will consult a Tumblr called Justin Bieber's Bulge, a blog \"dedicated to Justin Bieber's glorious, wonderful bulge,\" which is not run by me. For a Tumblr devoted to one man's dick, it's a pretty boring blog, but there is one compelling photo.", "Here is a fan shot of Justin Bieber in concert, his leather drop-crotch pants dropped well below his crotch. We can see a hint of bulge, and from this angle it does not look like Justin Bieber is trying to smuggle a butternut squash through airport security, as Calvin Klein might want us to believe.", "That is evidence supporting the theory that Justin Bieber is adequately endowed. Arguing in favor of Justin Bieber's alleged big dick are two people: Tati Neves, a Brazilian model, and Bieber's trainer Patrick Nilsson. These two claim to have seen Bieber's flesh in the flesh, and if we're to believe them, Calvin Klein has staked its reputation on the right massive dong.", "Neves claims to have slept with Bieber during his infamous Brazilian sex romp. Here is what she told a British tabloid about Bieber's D:", "Speaking to The Sun, Brazilian model Tati Nevas said: \"Take it from me, he's well endowed - and very good in bed.\"", "Nilsson, meanwhile, was shuttled out to do damage control in the wake of the Calvin Klein Photoshop controversy. Here, according to Breathe Heavy, is his assessment:", "And to make up it, here's a new quote from Justin's trainer Patrick Nilsson, who says JB is packing. \"I can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy. I sound weird saying that, but yes.\"", "Indeed you do.", "Two people claim to have personal connections with Justin Bieber's dick and claim it is large, but one is on Justin Bieber's payroll. While we will consider their opinions, the overwhelming visual evidence suggests that Justin Bieber's penis is perfectly average—large enough to adequately fill out a pair of briefs, but not so large that it could arouse envy and terror when plastered across sprawling billboards, or choke a cow, without enhancement.", "In this case, it appears, Justin Bieber is the same as any man.", "Still, we don't know for sure, and here is where we turn to you, our readers: Have you ever had sex with Justin Bieber?

Soldiers are virtually guaranteed to develop discipline, a collaborative spirit and an ability to think on their feet before they emerge from Fort Knox’s walls to return to the civilian world.", "And those are often the intangible qualities that make people reliable employees and innovators.", "\"The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they’re healthy, they stay out of trouble,\" Herd said. \"So we take those people and we train them and discipline them and mature them and we steal them for a few years and then we give them back to society.\"", "The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they’re healthy, they stay out of trouble. Retired Col. Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program", "The Visit To An Army Base That Inspired A New Initiative", "Pickett got the idea for the program after taking a group tour of Fort Irwin, the Army’s training center in California. There she saw the life-size replicas of entire towns in Afghanistan and Iraq that soldiers trained in before being deployed to war zones overseas.", "It is the crucible that turns young high-school graduates into hardened adults, ready to face unknown physical and mental challenges in a foreign nation.", "\"What was so striking to me -- this was really my first kind of up close with the military -- I remember this captain who told us, their job is to make every soldier that comes through there have their worst day in the service happen at Fort Irwin so it doesn’t happen somewhere else,\" Pickett said.", "To Pickett, it was obvious that any soldiers that underwent training at that base -- let alone the experiences that followed -- would make for terrific employees and members of the community. If they could make it through Fort Irwin, wouldn’t they make a superb supply chain manager for UPS?", "\"I wish every American could go through there,\" Pickett said. \"I was just inspired by it.\"", "Daniel Marans Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant, co-founded Where Opportunity Knox.", "Translating \"Army-Speak\" To \"Corporate-Speak\"", "Given how intuitively appealing these veterans sound as employees, one would think veterans would have a relatively low unemployment rate.", "But unemployment among young, post-9/11 veterans has been higher than among their non-veteran peers.", "In 2014, the unemployment rate among post-9/11 veterans was 7.2 percent, compared with 6 percent among non-veterans. For post-9/11 veterans ages 18 to 24, the jobless rate was 16.2 percent, compared with 12.5 percent among non-veterans of the same age. (The figures have since declined, but on the advice of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are using annual data here for greatest possible accuracy.)", "The reasons are complicated. The high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury among returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans no doubt plays a role -- though that may be more due to employers’ stigmas about the conditions than their actual effects.", "There are other factors, however, that have more to do with the military’s separation from civilian society. The networks that soldiers rely on to advance in the military often do not extend into the civilian world. As a result, it is hard to make professional connections with peers in the civilian world that are so essential to finding a job in today’s economy.", "Herd believes that departing soldiers are also sometimes unsure how to present the broader attributes they acquire in the military as professional assets in the civilian world.", "The hard part comes in translating those skills from Army/Navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable. Kathy Robinson, founder, Turning Point", "Kathy Robinson, founder of TurningPoint, a Boston-based career counseling firm, and a former human resources executive, has worked alongside veterans, recruited them to work for companies and advised them on finding work.", "\"Veterans bring a lot to the table when it comes to collaboration, ability to assess a vision and execute on that vision. When I was working with veterans they were often the most effective people in their jobs,\" Robinson said. \"The hard part comes in translating those skills from Army/Navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable.\"", "In fact, those with the most easily translatable skills often have a harder time realizing the value of the attributes they have honed in the military -- let alone communicating them in terms employers can easily grasp. Herd notes that machine gunners and infantrymen, who worked in positions that do not exist in the civilian world, are less likely to be unemployed than Army truck drivers, who can easily become civilian truck drivers.", "Fred Johnson Fred Johnson volunteers with Healing and the Arts to help younger veterans cope with PTSD.", "\"You Can Actually See The Community Change.\"", "Johnson, the Army vet, sees another challenge in the transition to civilian life. Like many veterans, Johnson wanted a job that provided him with a sense of purpose like the kind he enjoyed in the Army.", "Given Johnson’s worries about the applicability of his Army skills in the civilian world altogether, he did not think he would have the luxury of finding a job that fit that description.", "That was before he met with the folks at Where Opportunity Knox.", "They told him about an opening at Fund for the Arts, a Louisville nonprofit that raises money for arts supplies and programs in Louisville’s underprivileged schools. Johnson is now the organization’s director of workplace giving.", "\"I had a certain idea in mind for what I wanted to do and they helped me work through that,\" Johnson said. \"They helped me learn how to go through the civilian interview process. I knew what I wanted and they helped me articulate that in a way that made sense.\"", "Through his work at Fund for the Arts, Johnson sees himself as part of a process of community building in the underserved west side of Louisville. He compares it to the reconstruction work he did in the Iraqi city of Baquba after the Army brigade he led helped conquer it.", "I tell them, 'Follow your heart, not the money.' You can actually see the community change. Fred Johnson, Army veteran and director of workplace giving, Fund for the Arts", "\"When we attacked that city it was like a wasteland,\" Johnson said. \"Then we helped rebuild the city. We are trying to do that here in Louisville. On the west side, it is almost barren -- it almost reminds me of Baquba.\"", "In addition to the Army instilling in him a desire to be a part of something greater than himself, Johnson said his service equipped him with communication skills and a comfort with diversity of all kinds. Both of those characteristics are assets to him in his fundraising work.", "\"The vast majority of people in the Army -- unless you don’t do your work, who cares? Same thing with a female, a gay person, or any ethnic or racial minority,\" Johnson added. \"The west side [of Louisville] is very poor and racially diverse. I fit in as well there as at Humana or Brown-Forman where everybody is wearing suits.\"", "But Johnson said he was also fortunate that Fund for the Arts was willing to give him an opportunity to prove himself despite his lack of formal fundraising experience -- and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "\"I told [Fund for the Arts CEO] Christen Boone, this is what [my PTSD] means and this is what I am doing to overcome it,\" Johnson said. \"I said I am bringing more positive baggage than negative. She took a chance on me. I wish more CEOs and executives had the courage.\"", "And prove himself Johnson has. Local magazine Business First recently named him one of Louisville’s top 20 veterans in business.", "Now Johnson is using his experience to help younger returning veterans find their way. He volunteers with a joint civilian-military initiative called Arts and Healing. The group uses art to help veterans cope with PTSD.", "\"I tell them, ‘Follow your heart, not the money,\" Johnson said. \"You can actually see the community change.\"", "Where Opportunity Knox helped give Johnson the confidence that the skills he acquired in the Army had prepared him well for a civilian career. He explains to younger veterans that they too have attained those skills, even if they do not yet know it.", "\"A lot of time the younger kids do not realize what they’ve learned,\" he observed. \"They are 21 years old -- I say, ‘No, dude, you experienced a lifetime in that short span.

He was Sharifian — that is, he claimed descent from Muhammad, the founder of Islam.", "Ismaïl's rule was the longest in Moroccan history, and toward its end he controlled the country with an army of more than 150,000 men. Ismaïl was infamously ruthless — his reign is said to have begun with the display of 400 heads at the city of Fez, most of them from enemy chiefs, and over the next 55 years it is estimated he killed more than 30,000 people, not including those in battle.", "Any suspicion of adultery against Ismaïl was severely punished. The women were either strangled by the sultan himself, or their breasts were cut off, or their teeth torn out. Men who merely looked at one of his wives or concubines were punished by death.", "According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Ismaïl fathered 888 children, the greatest number of progeny for anyone throughout history that can be verified. Based on reports by Dominique Busnot, a French diplomat who frequently traveled to Morocco, the sultan may actually have had 1,171 children from four wives and 500 concubines by 1704. At that time, Ismaïl was 57 and had ruled for 32 years.", "Some researchers claimed it was unlikely Ismaïl could have fathered that many offspring, noting that women are only fertile for a small window each month, that sperm usually do not fertilize eggs, and that infertility often afflicts women, especially in the developing world. However, other scientists argued women are more fertile than those doubting Ismaïl had said.", "To solve this question, scientists developed computer simulations to see how many times Ismaïl had to have sex each day to have 1,171 children in 32 years. They found the sultan could have set this record.", "\"We were as conservative as possible with our calculations, and Moulay could still achieve this outcome,\" study lead author Elisabeth Oberzaucher, an anthropologist at the University of Vienna, told Live Science.", "The simulations were based on a variety of models of conception. For instance, one set of simulations assumed the menstrual cycles of women do not synchronize, while another suggested they could. Other factors included how good Ismail's sperm were at fertilizing women's eggs as he aged and how women often may look more sexually attractive when they are most fertile during their menstrual cycles.", "The simulations suggest Ismaïl needed to have sex an average of 0.83 to 1.43 times per day in order to father 1,171 children in 32 years. Moreover, the sultan did not need a harem of four wives and 500 concubines to sire that many offspring — the researchers suggest he needed a harem of only 65 to 110 women.", "Although the models of conception the researchers employed ultimately all found that Ismaïl could have actually had all these children, \"the results from them were all quite different from each other,\" Oberzaucher said. \"This really emphasizes to us how important it is to choose the right model for studies of reproduction — you really want to know what kind of women you actually are doing your calculations with, thinking about where women are in their life cycles and the sexual habits of women.\"", "Oberzaucher and her colleague Karl Grammer detailed their findings Feb. 14 in the journal PLOS ONE."], "targetTitle": "'Bloodthirsty' Moroccan Ruler Really Could Have Fathered 1,000 Kids, Computer Simulation Shows", "targetDescription": "Sultan Moulay Ismaïl of Morocco, \"The Bloodthirsty,\" reputedly sired hundreds of children and perhaps more than a 1,000.

Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is purely coincidental.\" The cut-and-paste legal rider must be the most boring thing in every movie that features it. Who knew its origins were so lurid?", "For that bit of boilerplate, we can indirectly thank none other than Grigori Rasputin, the famously hard-to-assassinate Russian mystic and intimate of the last, doomed Romanovs. It all started when an exiled Russian prince sued MGM in 1933 over the studio’s Rasputin biopic, claiming that the American production did not accurately depict Rasputin’s murder. And the prince ought to have known, having murdered him.", "Here’s the story. In 1916, the fabulously wealthy, Oxford-educated Prince Felix Yusupov was one of several Russian aristocrats agonizing over the unseemly influence that Rasputin—the magical healer, charismatic lech, and peasant—had over the czar and, particularly, the czarina. In December, Yusupov invited Rasputin to his palace, where he offered him cyanide-laced cakes and then shot him.", "Although the czarina was distraught, the czar let Yusupov off lightly, exiling the prince and his wife Irina. (In doing so, he inadvertently spared them from the impending slaughter of the revolution.)", "A Slate Plus Special Feature: Radio Drama Has Returned to the Spotlight—Now What? The Culture Gabfest’s producer explains why radio drama isn’t dead. Listen to this special Slate Plus bonus segment by joining – your first two weeks are free.", "Sixteen years later, MGM produced Rasputin and the Empress, based on those events. Its big coup was casting the three Barrymore siblings—stars of stage and silent film—in the lead roles. Lionel played Rasputin, Ethel the czarina, and John (grandfather of Drew) was \"Prince Paul Chegodieff,\" a composite, who murders Rasputin.", "Yusupov, now penniless in Paris, heard about the film and thought it defamatory. He argued audiences would recognize him in the fictional assassin—in part because he’d publicly cashed in on his infamy, penning a braggy memoir about killing Rasputin. He wasn’t wrong: The New York Times, in its review, noted that Chegodieff was \"really intended to represent [Yusupov].\"", "But having copped to being a murderer, Yusupov couldn’t build much of a libel case. Instead, he alleged that Rasputin and the Empress in fact defamed his wife.", "In the film, Chegodieff’s wife is \"Princess Natasha,\" a supporter of Rasputin. But the mystic, wary of her husband, hypnotizes and rapes her, rendering Natasha—by his logic, with which she agrees—unfit to be a wife. Yusupov contended that as viewers would equate Chegodieff with Yusupov, so would they link Natasha with Irina. But while Yusupov was portrayed more or less accurately, Irina and Rasputin had never met. (The scene also libeled Rasputin, but him being dead, you could say anything, then as now: \"Rasputin sucks,\" \"Rasputin liked to caress his big beard and give it little kisses,\" etc.)", "An MGM researcher had pointed out this factual discrepancy to the studio during production and warned that the Yusupovs could sue; the studio fired her. MGM was satisfied, dramatically, with the rape scene, despite there being no basis for it in real life. If it was shock they were interested in, one could imagine them constructing a similar scene around Rasputin and the czarina—about whom there were prurient rumors, which Rasputin himself encouraged by whipping his dick out in a restaurant and boasting of giving it to \"the old girl\"—but MGM couldn’t do that after casting a real-life brother and sister in those roles.", "Poster via Wikimedia Commons", "Irina Yusupov sued the studio, and the jury found in her favor, awarding her £25,000, or about $125,000. MGM had to take the film out of circulation for decades and purge the offending scene for all time.", "What proved to be MGM’s undoing was its lack of deniability. Unwisely, they’d prefaced the film with this: \"This concerns the destruction of an empire ... A few of the characters are still alive—the rest met death by violence.\" From that, audiences could logically infer that the Yusupovs, being the only relevant characters still alive, were represented as the Chegodieffs.", "A justice in the case told MGM that the studio might have stood a better chance had they incorporated a disclaimer stating the exact opposite: that the film was not intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events.", "Apparently overcautious in the wake of the landmark lawsuit, the film industry slapped that wording on everything. For decades, films disclaimed absolutely any relationship to reality—even when it was patently untrue.

His reason is unbelievable!..."], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["LINCOLN, Neb. — A 34-year-old Lincoln man purchased a 2012 Harley-Davidson Softail Slim motorcycle this past Tuesday in an effort to cut down on his perceived duty to wave to other motorcyclists.", "Russell \"Rusty\" Brandt entered Frontier Harley-Davidson’s front door around 11 a.m. with more than a thousand dollars in his wallet. A few hours later, he had completed the transaction, having agreed to pay $11,900 for the used motorcycle.", "\"I learned to ride when I lived in Creighton, and there weren’t many people there. Sometimes I would see people I didn’t know, and they would wave to me. I didn’t even put two and two together that they were waving at me just because I was on a motorcycle,\" Brandt explained. \"It probably happened half a dozen times in two years. I moved here to Lincoln and learned that other riders wave a lot. They expect you to wave back. It’s almost like a religion.\"", "Brandt said the waving was the impetus for his purchase. He rode in on a 2012 Honda Shadow, which he traded in to Frontier Harley-Davidson towards the purchase price of his new motorcycle.", "\"When you ride a Harley, you just don’t have to wave,\" Brandt said. \"If a guy on a Suzuki doesn’t wave, you have to wonder if he didn’t see you, or if he was using the clutch. Maybe he was having a bad day, but you don’t want to assume that, because you really don’t even know the other rider. But when you see a Harley, you know why the guy on it doesn’t wave. It’s because he’s on a Harley. In fact, guys on the Harley machines don’t even wave to riders on other Harleys!\"", "When asked about the inconvenience of having to trade in his motorcycle for a bike of another marque and the resulting monetary loss, Brandt was able to put things into perspective in terms of a simple cost-benefit analysis.", "\"The Shadow was a really good bike. Really good. I mean, I didn’t even want to get rid of it, but let’s get right down to the nitty-gritty. You don’t have to wave if you’re on a Harley. I just want to take some of the pressure off when I want to go out for a ride, and if I have to cough up some money to do that, so be it. It will be worth it.\"", "Brandt mentioned some safety aspects that he says other riders don’t consider. Safety was a big consideration in his decision to purchase the big Harley machine.", "\"Last week, I didn’t wave to a guy I passed on the left. I was in the middle of shifting gears, and didn’t think about it. About a mile later, I’m stopped at a red light, and the guy comes up to me and starts interrogating me about why I didn’t return his wave. He was really losing it. I went right home and told my wife. I told her I was trading the bike. I have a family. I can’t have people I don’t know coming up to me and yelling at me unannounced.\"", "Still, Brandt remained positive about his future in motorcycling.", "\"It’s really not that big of a deal.

Miley Cyrus", "Miley likely ranked the highest on Google's list because of twerking. She spent 2013 breaking off an engagement, smoking a blunt on stage (at the EMAS), and swinging around on a wrecking ball, naked and crying. You probably missed a lot of important news while all that was happening.", "2. Drake", "Drake is a surprise at second place, especially on a list that also contains the name \"Beyonce.\" Although, the year wasn't without accomplishments for the rapper. He helped Beyonce with \"Beyonce,\" briefly starred in \"Anchorman 2\" and received multiple Grammy nods (despite not showing up for the nominations concert).", "3. Kim Kardashian", "Kim Kardashian is almost constantly the subject of rumors -- the most recent of which alleges she waxed North West's eyebrows. On top of the usual obsession with her every move, the woman who is famous for being famous had a baby, received an enormous engagement ring via Jumbotron proposal and made the shockingly unsurprising decision to televise yet another wedding.", "4. Justin Bieber", "Le petit Canadian has been spitting all over the place since early January. He abandoned his pet monkey in Germany, said he hoped Anne Frank \"would have been a Belieber\" and peed in a bucket while insulting a former president. In any case, all of of his antics seem to have tired him out: he announced Dec. 18 that he's \"retiring.\"", "5. Beyonce", "At number one on Bing's list, Bey surprisingly came in only midway down Google's results. Of all the Bey moments of 2013, the most surprising / awesome / life-changing thing was obviously her surprise visual album (which quickly sold over one million albums and rose to No. 1). The Queen of the Universe doesn't need salacious headlines to keep you talking.", "6. Rihanna", "Rihanna made waves when she wore a doobie wrap to the AMAs, at which her mother presented her with the honor of the first-ever Icon Award. The Barbadian also spent 2013 posting various Instagrams of her butt that seemed to culminate in her controversial \"Pour It Up\" video, featuring a denim thong.", "7. Taylor Swift", "America's most famous jam maker faked surprised over a lot of awards in 2013. Earlier in the year, she said some definitely not endearing things about there being a \"special place in hell\" for Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, but the 24-year-old was able to make amends by a PR repair that including leaving a very sizable tip and inviting Lorde to her birthday party.", "8. Selena Gomez", "In 2013, Selena Gomez conducted her \"Stars Dance\" tour after ending things with petit Canadian Justin Bieber. Her personal life also included a scuffle with Lorde, an enduring friendship with with Taylor Swift and lots of short shorts. Gomez briefly came under fire for her MTV movie awards performance, which included the inappropriate use of a bindi as an accessory.", "9.

(Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post)", "In 2012, voters in California approved a measure to raise taxes on millionaires, bringing their top state income tax rate to 13.3 percent, the highest in the nation. Conservative economists predicted calamity, or at least a big slowdown in growth. Also that year, the governor of Kansas signed a series of changes to the state's tax code, including reducing income and sales tax rates. Conservative economists predicted a boom.", "Neither of those predictions came true. Not right away -- California grew just fine in the year the tax hikes took effect -- and especially not in the medium term, as new economic data showed this week.", "Now, correlation does not, as they say, equal causation, and two examples are but a small sample. But the divergent experiences of California and Kansas run counter to a popular view, particularly among conservative economists, that tax cuts tend to supercharge growth and tax increases chill it.", "California's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth of the year. That was up from 3.1 percent growth for the Golden State in 2014, which was near the top of the national pack.", "The Kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015. That's down from 1.2 percent in 2014, and below neighboring states such as Nebraska (2.1 percent) and Missouri (1.2 percent). Kansas ended the year with two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- a shrinking economy. By a common definition of the term, the state entered 2016 in recession.", "[Kansas had the ultimate plan to punish the poor]", "Other effects of the Kansas tax cuts, which were meant to spur entrepreneurship, are well-documented.", "While state officials anticipated that the reductions would create a shortfall in the state budget, tax revenues have been consistently below even those expectations. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service have signaled that they could reduce Kansas’s credit rating, indicating there is a chance the state cannot pay its bills.", "The shortfalls have forced Gov. Sam Brownback (R) and lawmakers to make additional adjustments. The state canceled the initial reduction in sales taxes, then increased them again, while delaying additional scheduled reductions in the income tax.", "On the whole, Brownback’s policies modestly increased taxes for the poor and working class, who pay more in sales taxes than income taxes, while reducing taxes drastically for the rich.", "The poorest 20 percent of households -- those making less than $23,000 a year -- are paying about $200 more, on average, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington. For the middle class, the changes have been a wash, with less-affluent households paying somewhat more and more-affluent households giving up a little less.", "Meanwhile, the wealthiest 1 percent of households, those making at least $493,000 a year, are saving an average of $25,000.", "[Bernie Sanders is right: The top 0.1 percent have as much as the bottom 90 percent]", "Kansas’s gross domestic product is still less than it was at the end of 2011, said Menzie Chinn, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has been following Kansas’s economy. Meanwhile, the economy in the rest of the country continues to expand.", "\"It’s remarkable,\" Chinn said.", "It is perhaps less remarkable -- or surprising -- that California has powered along. The recovery nationwide has favored massive metropolitan areas stocked with high-skilled workers, which is to say places such as Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco. The damage from California's deep housing crash has slowly healed in places such as the Central Valley.", "Still, the noncoastal regions of California lag far behind Silicon Valley and Los Angeles in their job and growth recoveries.

That means even Vin Diesel -- who, thanks to the \"Fast and Furious\" movies, stars in one of the most popular film franchises in existence -- had to independently finance the third \"Riddick\" movie. How did he get here?", "Let's start with \"The Chronicles of Riddick,\" the sequel to \"Pitch Black,\" which was released on June 11, 2004. The film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the North American box office, making it one of that summer's costly misfires. After that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, Universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new film's reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million.", "Maybe, though, that was for the best. In this new installment, we find Riddick (Diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet. After a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for Riddick. So, Riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as \"Riddick\" director David Twohy calls him, \"the bogey man.\" It's something Twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie.", "Did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after \"The Chronicles of Riddick\" underperformed?", "Yeah, I had my doubts after the second one. And we suffered some slings and arrows. According to the studio, we spent way too much money and didn't make enough back. So, that's never a good formula. So, I had my doubts. If you speak with Vin, I'm thinking he would say, \"Never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie\" -- because that's just the kind of guy he is. He is a big dreamer. I'm more the pragmatist of the duo.", "Vin Diesel has had quite the resurgence over the last couple of years.", "Look, I've learned never to count Vin Diesel out. Just don't do that. And I guess it's because he is a very smart guy. Smarter than people give him credit for.", "I enjoyed that in \"Riddick\" the stakes are big to the characters, but not compared to all of the big summer movies we just saw. These people basically just need to leave a planet and that's it.", "And look, I've been in those meetings, too. Where it's, \"We have to up the stakes. We have to give it a ticking clock\" ... So, I hope that \"Riddick,\" if nothing else, feels a little more handmade than factory-made. That's what I set out to do and Vin was certainly along for that ride, too.", "The first half hour, we're pretty much alone with Riddick. Then the film focuses on the bounty hunters and Riddick becomes almost the bad guy, even though we spent the first part of the movie with him.", "That's right. Now, that's something the studio would have fret out about. \"Wait a second. You are totally sympathetic with Riddick while he's trying to survive, but then you're using him as the bogey man.\"", "Why did you want to do that?", "Because he is both those things. He is a man. He is a survivor -- a survivor with skills. And enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to us, but, at the same time, never let the audience forget that he's a stone cold killer. But, you know I think it works. Because I have to introduce those new characters ... I have like 10 new characters to establish. And I can bolster Riddick's roar -- his legend -- by having them talk about him as they glimpse him.", "Do you think the success of the \"Fast and Furious\" movies helped to get \"Riddick\" made?", "Yes. But, here's the cyclical nature of the business. Because \"Pitch Black\" did well, that allowed him to be part of the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise. And guess what? What goes around, comes around. So, on the basis of that, he was dropped into a major part in \"The Fast and the Furious.\" And based on the success of that, yes, that does impact on our ability to launch this third one. Even though Universal didn't want to make it at a certain point. In fact, they didn't make it. Do you know that story?", "I do not.", "It goes like this. After \"Chronicles,\" they said, \"We are out of the Riddick business. It's just a straight business calculation of us. You spent too much money and you didn't make enough back. So, no, we're not going to do anymore.\" Vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, \"Well, give me the rights back.\" And they didn't want to do that ... I think this was about the time that \"Fast 3\" had already shot and they were testing it. Maybe it wasn't testing as well as it should have and they decide, \"Maybe we need a cameo from Vin\" -- because he wasn't in that movie. So, I do believe that in his savviness, Vin said, \"Don't pay me for that cameo. Just give me the rights back.\" So, his company basically controls the rights and because I control all of the sequels and remakes. So, we can't make a movie without each other, nor would we want to. So, that's how he got the rights back and I think that was a great business move.", "So, ultimately, we did it as an independent movie. I wrote a spec script. We sold it in Berlin for international. We came back into town looking for a domestic partner. I thought it was going to be Sony or Film District -- they were both eager to have the movie. And then, guess what? Universal raises their hand, \"Well, what about us?\" And I said, \"This doesn't feel right to me\" But Vin, he was saying, \"That was then, this is now\" ... So with the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and his relationship with Universal over that and the strength of those, we placed it again at Universal. So, the company that kicked us to the curb [laughs] picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the U.S. and Canada.", "So Universal didn't put any money into the film?", "They put money into it for their domestic distribution rights.", "So Riddick is an indie film?", "Here's an example of how it's an indie film. I wrote a spec script, we sold that. We went up to Montreal and I think I did one polish on my original script -- and then we shot that. Then, when it comes to editing, I got to the point when I wanted to show it to 50 people in a room, just to see what they understood: What was clear to them and what was not clear to them. Because of things aren't clear to them, the audience can't enjoy it and I still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up. I didn't have it scored and didn't fill out forms, I just stood in front of them and asked them questions ... I had the studio heads in once, but we were basically locked at that point.

Mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025", "Epinephrine, as a drug, was first synthesized more than a century ago. It’s been used for various medical applications since then, and was first packaged in an auto-injector (to protect soldiers against chemical warfare) back in the 1970s.", "But Mylan has a lock on the particular EpiPen design that millions of patients, parents, and school nurses have come to trust.", "The company’s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle, but releases automatically when a patient pushes an EpiPen against her thigh, so there’s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack.", "The very fact that the EpiPen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design.

Stepanian agrees that it’s more complicated than it seems at first glance: \"It’s really challenging to make a reliable auto-injector — and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product,\" he said.", "\"It’s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain, the plastics and design, and then incorporate that all together, and put the drug inside it — and then regardless of how the user uses it, get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limits of the FDA,\" Stepanian added. \"At least Mylan and Pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one.\"", "One EpiPen alternative that did make it to market: The Auvi-Q, an epinephrine auto-injector shaped like a bulky credit card. But Sanofi recalled the devices last year over concerns that patients weren’t getting the correct dose every time. It returned the commercial and marketing rights to Kaleo, from whom it licensed the auto-injector in 2009. A representative from Kaleo said that it’s \"in the process of evaluating when and how\" to bring the Auvi-Q back to the market — but Sanofi is no longer involved.", "3.

But it’s proved exceedingly tough to get patients to switch from a format of insulin intake they’re familiar with to an inhaler.

When I got my results back I was not surprised. There were no big revelations and, just as I suspected, I am not related to royalty. But I did wonder if I could learn anything more from the DNA report. That search sent me down a rabbit hole that lead me to the story of Michael Usry Jr., a young filmmaker who became a suspect in the Angie Dodge murder investigation.", "After getting my DNA report I learned that there are a number of genealogy sites, educational institutions and companies that are willing to offer you further insight into what your DNA may reveal, as long as you’re willing to upload your DNA profile to them. Some of these sites charge money, while others are simply willing to analyze your DNA profile in exchange for adding your profile to their database. I probably uploaded my profile to about four sites. One told me the type of workout supplements I should be taking, another searched public family trees for family connections. There was even one that promised to create a diet tailor made for me based on my DNA. I gave no thought to how my profile could be used by these companies or institutions down the road.", "Then I heard that the New York City Police Department was trying to get permission to do something called a \"familial DNA\" search. What does that mean?  Police hunting for a killer in a high-profile murder case wanted to use his DNA to search New York State’s criminal database for a relative of his. They had already searched for the killer, but he was not in the database. If they could find someone related to him they would have a family name, making it easier to track down the killer.  A quick search of the phrase \"familial DNA\" and I learned authorities in California had used it to apprehend a serial killer, who had eluded them for 25 years. The infamous \"Grim Sleeper,\" Lonny Franklin Jr., had a son who was serving time on a felony weapons charge, and his DNA had been uploaded to the California criminal database. A familial search connected father and son, allowing police to finally make an arrest.", "A little more searching and I stumbled across a blog post about a young filmmaker named, Michael Usry Jr. A familial search conducted by Idaho Falls police landed Usry in a stark interrogation room, where he was grilled by detectives and asked for his DNA, without any explanation. I tracked Usry down on Facebook and asked him to call me. When we finally spoke, he told the whole story. How his father had participated in a genealogical study through their church, giving a sample of his DNA to a public database, which was later purchased by Ancestry.com. Years later, in an attempt to crack the 20-year-old cold-case murder of Angie Dodge, police conducted a familial DNA search in that very database, and found an anonymous donor who appeared to be a very close match to the killer’s DNA. After obtaining a search warrant for Ancestry.com to reveal his name, detectives learned it was a man named Michael Usry Sr. When cops built out his family tree they found Usry had a son. Cops tracked him down and began investigating.", "As I talked with Michael Usry, he told me he was very angry about being caught up in the investigation, but he was even angrier about something else. There was a man serving time for Angie’s murder, Christopher Tapp, who Usry believes is innocent.", "After I hung up the phone, I started researching Angie Dodge’s murder and the case against Chris Tapp. I learned that authorities had never found Tapp’s DNA at the crime scene. Tapp was convicted and had at that point served nearly 20 years because of his own words, a confession he made to police. I was immediately struck by the fact that Michael Usry Jr. and Chris Tapp had found themselves in similar situations, 20 years apart. Both men said they knew nothing about the murder of Angie Dodge , both men had their DNA tested and both men did not match that of the killer, yet one man went to prison and the other man went home. That was the story I pitched to \"48 Hours\" executive producer Susan Zirinsky.", "Chris Tapp, serving time for the murder of Idaho teen Angie Dodge, shows CBS News correspondent Anne-Marie Green what his life is like inside the...", "The day both Michael Usry and I went to see Chris Tapp in prison, I was struck by how soft spoken and kind Tapp was. He cried twice that day, once when I asked about the moment in his interrogation when he began to implicate himself in Angie’s murder, and a second time when Michael Usry showed him a video of something that was shot for a documentary Usry is making about this case. It was an interview with Tapp’s wife, Lori, who Tapp had met and married while in prison. In the video, Lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence. The interview was conducted shortly before Lori was killed in a car crash, and this was the first time Tapp had heard her voice since the accident. I think there are many lessons in this case, but writing strictly as it relates to the privacy of DNA databases, the lesson is this: When you trade your DNA for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it. What if that company goes out of business and sells the database? Do the protections you have been promised still stand? What if an insurance company wants to know if you carry a specific gene that could increase your chances of getting cancer, or indicates a penchant for risk taking?  ", "Right now, the judicial system is playing catch up when it comes to your rights and protections, so we should all be aware and read the fine print. There is nothing wrong with wanting to know where you came from and what your genes can tell you about your health; just make sure you know what you are signing up for.

One Lin sibling designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; the other has written 12 books.", "Each of these families is different in thousands of ways, from their ethnicities to their incomes to their sleepover policies. But we set out to find the ways they are the same.", "In selecting candidates to study, we ignored siblings who do the same work in the same industry (like Venus and Serena Williams) and families that come from a great fortune or legacy (like the Trumps or the Kennedys). We looked for families in which all the siblings did well. And we defined success by leadership, service or achievement, not just fame or money alone. Of course, genetics plays a role for every family, but we focused on upbringing and sibling dynamics instead.", "Some of the consistencies are fairly predictable. While none of these siblings grew up rich, they were privileged in many other ways. They had involved parents and lots of opportunities, and most saw college as achievable, even inevitable. They weren’t abused or neglected, and none grew up in abject want. They didn’t have an unfair head start, but they were spared some of the most difficult obstacles faced by less fortunate kids.", "But other commonalities are more specific, and more telling. Of the nine families, eight had a parent who was an immigrant or an educator, and five had a parent who was both. Many parents were involved in political activism of some kind. Most recall a conflict-heavy family life, but that conflict was rarely between the parents. Many had a strong awareness of mortality as children. And most said they grew up with much more freedom than their friends did.", "We talked to mayors and poets and judges and rappers, Jews from Chicago and Indians from Kansas and Haitians from Nebraska.

In the Srinivasan household, less was required—but more was expected.", "There was no one person responsible for the trash or dishes. \"It was more like, ‘Look around. What’s Mom doing? Does she need help?’\" recalls Srinija, the youngest. \"Put things away. Pay attention.\"", "Also, nobody got an allowance. Instead, a drawer in the living-room table contained petty cash for anyone to use. \"On the one hand, it meant great permissiveness that is way better than an allowance,\" says Srinija. \"On the other hand, responsibility for every choice.\" Her older sister Srija put it this way: \"If I took $20, that meant Sri and Srinija couldn’t go to the movies.\"", "The Srinivasan Family", "Left and Right: Courtesy of the Srinivasan Family", "The three kids, now adults, say they grew up understanding that the family was more important than the individual, a realization made especially poignant by the fact that their parents had left their own families behind to immigrate to the U.S.", "For the Srinivasans, that sacrifice paid off.

Their upbringing was stricter than their friends’: the kids weren’t allowed to have sleepovers, they couldn’t go to a friend’s home unless their mother Nicole had met the parents, and one bad grade could lead to the confiscation of beloved toys.

On their school vacations, the girls were usually dragged to physics conferences, where they would torment the world-­famous scientists. They threw paper airplanes during presentations, hurled small objects off hotel balconies and even came up with an elaborate fashion-consulting prank to trick academics into changing their ugly ties.", "But the academic environment also instilled a comfort with complex ideas and a confidence in asking questions. \"Because we grew up with a lot of strong academics, I think one of the skills we have is not being intimidated,\" says Susan. \"It’s never like, ‘Oh, this person is so important, I can’t challenge him.’\"", "The Wojcicki Family", "Left: Courtesy of the Wojcicki Family; Right: Cody Pickens for TIME", "Esther had begun her daughters’ ed­ucation long before they were peppering Stanford physicists with questions about nuclear particles.

With a few notable exceptions, most described a sibling dynamic that was wildly competitive at best and physically violent at worst. They grew up in controlled chaos: heavy on conflict, light on manners and indifferent to standards of appropriate behavior.", "Few recalled major rifts between their parents. But many of these siblings said they regularly fought with their brothers and sisters over everything from clothing to board games to who had to sit in the middle seat on long car trips. Zeke Emanuel puts it this way: \"If there wasn’t blood, it was a good night.\"", "Mealtime debates could get so vicious, they horrified outsiders. Joel Gay recalls that his wife was on the verge of tears when she first had dinner with his family. \"She said, ‘I have never seen anything like that. Why are you screaming at each other?’\" he remembers. \"If you don’t under­stand Haitian culture, you can think we’re actually fighting.\"", "The Simmons Family", "Left: Courtesy of the Simmons Family; Right: Anthony Behar—Sipa Press/AP", "Some of the rowdy behavior sounds like normal, run-of-the-mill mischief. Roxane and Joel Gay pushed their baby brother Michael down the stairs in a laundry basket. Susan and Janet Wojcicki loved to trick a young Anne into approaching strangers and calling them \"fat.\" Gina Rodriguez once put glue in her sister Rebecca’s milk.", "They committed all the venial sins of American teenagers, and some of the cardinal ones as well. Across the nine families, there were incidents of teenage parenthood, smoking pot, underage drinking, cutting school, bar fights, shoplifting and drag racing. At least two had parties when their parents weren’t home. Esther Wojcicki says she found out about her daughters’ secret house party only when a student came to school wearing clothes pilfered from her own closet. (Her daughters dispute that particular anecdote.)", "For some of these siblings, growing up in a constant state of trial-by-­combat made them tougher. For others, the bad behavior was a symptom of their willingness to make mistakes, an anti-­perfectionism that hardened into resilience. It wasn’t just that they fought; it was that they fought and then moved on. \"We were called a lot of bad names, and we had to withstand that and continue to go on,\" says Zeke Emanuel. \"That breeds a certain kind of toughness.\"", "And though few openly admit it, sibling rivalry can motivate achievement, says New York University psychologist Ben Dattner: \"Winning the Nobel Prize is a more civilized way of beating the crap out of your brother.\"", "LESSONS IN MORTALITY", "Jack and Rachel Antonoff can’t describe their childhood without discussing the third Antonoff: their younger sister Sarah, who died of a brain tumor when she was 13.", "Jack is a Grammy-winning musician who is the lead singer of Bleachers and lead guitarist of fun., now on hiatus. Rachel is a New York City–based fashion de­signer. They’re unlike many of the other eight families: their parents aren’t immigrants or educators, nobody in their family cared much about politics, and they didn’t break rules, because there weren’t any rules to break. Instead, since their sister’s death more than a decade ago, the Antonoffs say they’re motivated by a constant awareness of their own mortality.", "\"When you hear about a movie coming out that you’re excited to see, do you not think every time, Oh, I hope I’m still alive?\" Rachel asks, sitting in the Los Angeles studio where Jack is recording his latest album. Jack nods, digging into a cupcake in honor of his 32nd birthday. \"I have to get my gallbladder out, and I don’t want to do it until this record is done in case I die on the table,\" he says. \"Everything backs up to the amount of work I do before I die. That creates a work ethic. There’s an urgency.\"", "The Antonoff Family", "Left: Courtesy of the Antonoff Family; Right: Amy Lombard", "Posttraumatic growth is a tricky concept. For many kids and even adults, a loss of this magnitude may cause permanent devastation, not motivation. And yet while the Antonoffs experienced a loss significantly more shattering than most, many of the other eight families also experienced a brush with untimely death. The woman who was shot in the head in front of the Rodriguezes’ home was their cousin. The Simmons brothers saw friends and neighbors killed by drugs, AIDS and gang violence. Rahm Emanuel nearly died as a teenager when a deep cut in his finger developed into a bone infection. (He ended up losing half his finger.)", "Such experiences can fuel ambition. After spending weeks in the hospital battling that life-threatening infection, Rahm says, he transformed from a slacker student into a go-getter. \"I made sure that given how close I came to dying, that I was never, ever going to not get the most out of everything I was doing,\" he says. \"I was a changed person.\"", "It can also help a family get their priorities straight. Jack and Rachel’s mother Shira Antonoff said Sarah’s death drowned out all the petty judgments and expectations of their suburban New Jersey community. She let her kids skip school, she didn’t insist they finish college, and she took Jack to get his lip pierced at age 15, to the shock and dismay of other mothers in the grocery store.", "\"The core was, We’ve had a sick kid, we’ve had a kid who’s died, so let’s get real about what’s important here,\" Shira says. \"You’ve got to find a path in life that you’re really happy with.\"", "a free-range childhood", "Like many of the other siblings in this story, Tan and Maya Lin grew up on a university campus, were raised by immigrant parents and bickered constantly over board games. They were also allowed to do practically anything they wanted. You could say it was the opposite of helicopter parenting.", "Their father Henry Huan Lin had been forced to take calligraphy classes while growing up in China, an experience he loathed so much that it informed his parenting philosophy. \"He promised that when he had kids, they would never have to do anything they didn’t want to do,\" Maya says.", "And so the Lin parents, who fled Mao and ultimately became professors at Ohio University, didn’t monitor their children’s homework or force them to join sports teams or push them to learn the piano. \"We were given all sorts of freedom to do whatever we wanted,\" recalls Tan, now a poet and the author of a dozen books. Maya, an artist and architect who designed the Vietnam Veterans ­Memorial, puts it this way: \"They were the anti–dragon parents.\"", "The Lin Family", "Left and Right: Courtesy of the Lin Family", "The Lin siblings spent most of their time outside, or writing poems, or throwing clay in the university ceramics studio. They went to a high school with an open-module system, which meant that sometimes they went to class only two days a week. \"I’ve only ever chafed when there are rules,\" Maya says.", "Few of the siblings in this story had parents who closely monitored their movements, and many said they were raised with significantly more freedom than their friends. By the standards of today’s helicopter parents, they ran wild. The Dungey sisters rode all over Sacramento on their bikes alone. The Antonoffs were allowed to skip school whenever they wanted. Six-year-old Zeke Emanuel regularly escorted 4-year-old Rahm home from nursery school on a Chicago city bus.", "\"She was a supporter of us, but she didn’t tell us what to do, and she allowed us to play and develop our own ideas,\" says Zeke of his mother. \"She didn’t even worry too much whether they were safe or not.\"", "Esther Wojcicki taught her daughters to swim as soon as they could walk, specifically so that she wouldn’t have to watch them when they played near the backyard pool. \"I empowered them early, because I wanted to make sure they could take care of themselves,\" she says. \"They could read early, so they could read signs. They could do math early, so they could handle money.\"", "Even by the comparatively lax stan­dards of the 1970s, the Wojcicki girls had more freedom than most. Five-year-old Susan was often left to babysit 4-year-old Janet and infant Anne, and local mothers raised their eyebrows when the girls rode their bikes alone to the dime store a mile away.", "But Esther has a theory. \"The more you do for your kids, the less they do for themselves, and the less empowered they feel,\" she says.", "Thousands of extraordinary families flourish across America, and the new generation of hyperaware parents may raise thousands more. But none of the parents in this story set out to raise successful children. Instead, the six commonalities of our nine families combined to create drive, grit and social consciousness that propelled all the siblings on their own chosen paths.", "\"You cannot reach anybody’s goal. You’ve got to reach your own goal,\" says Gino Rodriguez. \"You cannot reach a goal unless you set that goal for yourself.\" That’s why I can and I will are five words without an object, a push without direction. Look how far it took them."], "targetTitle": "Super Families: Secrets of Raising Successful Children", "targetDescription": "This is a story about nine American families with children who all went on

Last month, I spoke with her about how she was able to retire, despite the fact that she only graduated from college about seven years ago. JP (a pen name she goes by on her blog, TheMoneyHabit.org) was able to retire because of her high earnings, lofty savings goals and disciplined investment techniques. Her investment strategies are part of what allowed her to build a net worth of about $2.25 million. ", "With less than a week left in the year, so many of us are setting goals for the new year, which includes figuring out an investment plan for 2017. Deciding on investment strategies or goals can help us figure out what we want our long-term financial picture to look like, and shape our budget for the coming year. When laying out an investing plan, who better to learn from than a woman whose investments boast high returns, and who retired before 30? In our Q&A, JP discusses her personal 2017 investment plan, and provides useful insights for investors looking to build their nest egg more aggressively. This interview has been edited for brevity.", "Maya Kachroo-Levine: You've had investments of over $1 million yield a 13% return ($130,000) in just one year. Can you speak to your investment strategy that year, and can you walk us through your 2016 investment strategy?", "JP Livingston: My investment strategy for several years has been a twist on a broadly discussed strategy to go long on equities.", "Many financial experts (those who aren't compensated for getting you to invest a certain way) will tell you that if you are young and in the wealth accumulation phase of your life, to consider parking your money in a low-cost index fund, for example, Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX).", "There are a few key arguments for this strategy. First, it's a nice hedge against inflation because the companies in the index are presumably raising their prices with inflation; since companies are valued on a multiple of revenue or profit, this will be captured in the growth of the stock market.", "Secondly, and most importantly, is that it's hard to argue with its results. The compound annual growth rate for stocks on the S&P Index for the last 30 years has been 11%. There are very few if any opportunities available to us regular individual investors that can top that kind of return for the risk. (Note: you'll get an entirely different view from hedge funds or mutual funds. They believe they can beat market returns and so they charge high fees for their time and efforts. A few of them are worth it. Most of them are not).", "Kachroo-Levine: What are you planning on changing about your strategy in 2017?", "Livingston: As a retiree, steady cash flow is going to matter more to me than it has in the past. There are only two ways to make money: appreciation and income. Stocks, for example, are about appreciation you make very little money on a regular basis (usually a puny 1%-2% in dividends), but a year or two or three later, you can sell it for much more than you paid and pocket the difference. A heavily appreciation-based strategy, like going 100% into index funds, will no longer meet my needs.", "Income-based strategies, by contrast, put a steady paycheck in the spotlight. Bonds are generally purchased for the interest they provide. Sure they can appreciate or depreciate in value, but the bulk of your return from a bond comes from the monthly or quarterly dividend it pays.", "I have a few years to build myself an income-based strategy, as I still have some deferred compensation coming from my old employer, but I'm looking to add one or two rental properties to my portfolio in 2017. Interest rates are still fairly low so it's not a bad time to be a borrower. I would also look at adding more bonds to my portfolio (specifically leveraged municipal bond funds; the leverage juices returns and municipal bonds are tax exempt), but I do not want to buy bonds right now, as the Fed has signaled a plan to increase interest rates (and even raised them just a week ago).", "Kachroo-Levine: What are your financial/investment goals for 2017? What are your priorities?", "Livingston: As I am newly retired, my main priority is transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year. I'm on the lookout for a rental property or two to take advantage of low interest rates and which will provide some much-needed steady income. In some parts of the country like San Francisco, rental properties are actually negative cash flow exercises and are predicated on appreciation. In some areas, it will throw off 6%-7% or more in income each year and fit my income needs. Real estate is hyperlocal like that.", "Kachroo-Levine: What are the key philosophies that help shape your investment strategy?", "Livingston: I feel I've gotten pretty far on just two things.First, don't be afraid to say you don't know.", "People get really weird and insecure when it comes to money. We're all lifelong learners. I have to admit I don't know basic things all the time. For example, while I've read quite a bit about real estate investment, I'm constantly finding myself with a giant question mark as I apply those concepts to my first live investments. My priority though is to make money and learn, not to impress people.", "Second: Don't give up until you really feel you understand something.  Finally, my other silver bullet question is to ask What are the arguments against it? or What are the three things that could break this strategy? There's no free lunch. Every strategy has some vulnerability.", "Kachroo-Levine: What advice can you offer for novice investors in 2017? Specifically, if you were speaking to people who had never invested beyond a 401(k) or IRA, what would you say to them?", "Livingston: You are in such an exciting place, because there is low-hanging fruit all around you. A few things:", "1. Money management is an incremental game, not a winner-take-all game. That means every tweak you make has a noticeable impact on your money, and it means you don't have to choose between going whole hog or absolute zero. You can devote however much time and effort you have and get proportional results and new ideas to employ.", "2. Momentum matters most. Start by joining a few interesting communities and blogs and read a little bit a few times a week. Cruise around on the Reddit Personal Finance forum. Investment is only painful or boring when you try to cram too much too fast, or you go find a dry, educational source and force feed yourself the information.", "Momentum is the most important piece when you start any new project. Too many people think Alright, it's time to do this investment stuff and go and buy some highly rated book on Amazon to start their education. That's such a self-defeating way to start. Is that how you got into skiing, or guitar or interpretive Celtic dance? Has that kind of textbook strategy ever succeeded in firing up your passion?", "Kachroo-Levine: For those seeking early retirement, can you share why your investments are so crucial to your early retirement journey?", "Livingston: Your nest egg is like an entire extra employee doing work for you, an employee that gets better and stronger and eventually eclipses you.", "Say you make $100,000 pre-tax and save $30,000 a year. Once your nest egg is three times your salary, or $300,000, at a 10% return it will generate as much as you slaving a whole year to put away has accomplished.", "At 10-times your salary and a 10% return, it is throwing off more money than you make in an entire year. You could be sitting on the beach drinking Mai Tais and still see a year's worth of salary come in just from your investments. Of course, you can't guarantee consistent 10% returns, but you have a long-term bet that you can achieve during your accumulation phase by investing in low-cost index funds.", "More on Forbes: "], "targetTitle": "How A 28-Year-Old Who Retired With A $2 Million Net Worth Is Investing In 2017", "targetDescription": "Check out exactly what her investing strategy looks like.", "targetKeywords": "", "targetMedia": null, "targetUrl": null, "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": null, "spoilerPublisher": null}, "spoiler": ["transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year"], "spoilerPositions": [[[12, 55], [12, 179]]], "tags": ["passage"]}

Does astrology use testable ideas?", "For something to have a true scientific basis, it has to encompass testable ideas.

For instance, a study tested the accuracy of astrological charts in describing the personality traits of 193 study participants, and the results indicated that the scores were at a level consistent with chance.", "So far, it can’t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence — and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself as valid.", "3. Does it attempt to explain the natural world?", "Yes, astrology’s basic premise is that the sun, moon, planets, and constellations have an effect on humans and earthly events. Further, it uses a set of rules about the relative positions and movements of the stars and planets to predict and explain worldly events and human personality.", "However, as Understanding Science explains, \"Although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid — and this is a key part of science.\"", "Plus, astrology doesn’t lead to ongoing research, which is another key part of science.", "So, unfortunately for everyone who swears their daily horoscope is always on point or blames their stubbornness on being a Scorpio or a Taurus, it appears that there’s not much scientific evidence to back those claims.

The change is a signifier of a major problem with nutrition in prisons. \"[Money] doesn’t change unless there’s some drastic change to the value in people using it,\" Gibson-Light said.", "He attributes ramen’s popularity to the fact that it’s \"easy to get\" and \"high in calories,\" something of value to people who \"spend their days working and exercising.\" They need the energy.", "Ramen has been popular in prison for a long time.

But what was in the insecticide, and how does it work?", "The main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact. Sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight.", "Naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the Environmental Protection Agency (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "However, in its own review of naled, the European Union came to a different conclusion. Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled.", "In Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment.", "By contrast, in Miami-Dade County, the Department of Solid Waste Management's Mosquito Control Section commonly sprays in response to state Department of Health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide.", "The Mosquito Control Section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. In fact, Dibrom has been used in the United States over the past 50 years, said Timothy J. Donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of AMVAC Chemical Corp ., which makes the insecticide.", "\"It is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year,\" Donnelly said.", "Since the variety of mosquito that carries Zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. Special precautions are not necessary, Miami-Dade County officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. During any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees.", "Aerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the CDC and Florida's Department of Health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including Zika. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions.", "\"When Naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly,\" said Bryn Phillips, a specialist in the University of California, Davis environmental toxicology department.", "His research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of Naled. One of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the \"low end of the food chain,\" like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- \"basically fish food,\" Phillips said.", "If the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, Phillips noted.", "Naled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. Very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. Those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. Since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely.", "Miami-Dade County's aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. BTI has been registered with the EPA since 1961 as a pesticide.", "Zika was discovered in 1947 in Uganda. An outbreak that began in Brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the Americas. Florida reported the nation's first local transmission of Zika from an infected mosquito in late July.", "Zika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders.", "Although spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, Phillips said.", "Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.", "\"You talk to the mosquito spraying guys, and they're all about human health, and they're OK with some impacts to the environment,\" he said.

I guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your children, the teacher will be able to explain how.", "Yes, Expo markers are expensive.

The supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. Used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. Glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren’t worth it anymore. Markers find new homes in backpacks. Pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal.

And yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. Maybe sad, but still true. And if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. And guess what? Kids don’t learn as well then.", "I’m frustrated that we can’t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. So, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up.

Though they've found massive success in an entirely separate business — the fashion world, and they've also become increasingly reclusive. And they don't smile. But we're getting ahead of ourselves here. There's a lot to unpack when it comes to the mysterious world of the Olsen twins, so let's dive right in and find out just how peculiar Mary-Kate and Ashley's lives have become.", "Banking on bad movies", "Yeah, Mary-Kate and Ashley made a lot of money splitting the role of Michelle Tanner on Full House (1987-1995), but they continued to rake in beaucoup bucks when the popular sitcom ended. Their net worth in 2018 was an estimated $400 million combined. How have these child stars remained rich when so many of their peers have struggled?", "The twins earned much of their fortune making unintentionally laughable direct-to-video movies — 45 to be exact, according to Elle. Their most famous film, New York Minute (2004), earned a dismal 11 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes – and the bulk of those percentage points are probably owed to co-star Eugene Levy — yet none of that stopped the movie from collecting more than $21 million worldwide. It's the same for much of their video oeuvre, which was largely ignored by critics. However, their 1995 collaboration with Steve Guttenberg and Kirstie Alley, It Takes Two, did garner enough attention to pull in 8 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.", "In spite of all the critical panning, Elle claims that the twins' film career raked in a startling $750 million dollars. Call us crazy, but we'd trade in every bad review ever written in exchange for that kind of scratch.", "The Mary-Kate - Heath Ledger connection", "It seems to have been forgotten over the years that Mary-Kate was somehow linked with actor Heath Ledger's death in 2008. While there was never any suggestion of foul play, Mary-Kate's name was involved from the moment the Dark Knight star's body was discovered. When Ledger's masseuse found him unconscious in his New York City home, the first person she called was Mary-Kate, twice, instead of 911.", "According to the Daily Mail, when the masseuse finally determined she should reach out to the authorities, Mary-Kate \"sent over her security team who arrived at [Ledger's] flat at the same time as the ambulance.\" Stranger still, multiple news sources reported that Mary-Kate refused to talk to federal investigators about Ledger's death unless she was granted immunity. Why was she so concerned about being implicated for something? Did it have anything to do with Ledger's accidental overdose on prescription pills?", "Her attorney, Michael C. Miller, denied she had anything to hide. \"Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger's home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them,\" Miller said in a statement.", "Mary-Kate's stonewall tactic eventually worked when the DEA and federal prosecutors closed the inquiry into Ledger's death in August of 2008. \"The U.S. Attorney of the Southern District decided not to serve Olsen with a subpoena,\" a source told the New York Daily News, which effectively let Olsen off the hook for any further speculation.", "Opioid crisis? What opioid crisis?", "The Olsens are now successful fashion designers. With multiple clothing labels to their name, the twins offer everything from affordable children's clothing all the way up to haute couture. And while they kicked off their careers with threads sold exclusively at Walmart, they really shot to the top of the catwalk when they unleashed a $55,000 pill-covered handbag associated with their label The Row in 2012.", "That's right, these two helped create a black crocodile leather backpack covered with prescription pills and called it high fashion. According to Entertainment Weekly, the must-have accessory for the fashionable pharma rep was the result of a collaboration with artist Damien Hirst, whose pill-centric work was previously featured in some of his other installations, called Pill Cabinets. So you should be sensing a theme here, is what we're getting at.", "At any rate, this ghastly accessory celebrating drug culture seems even more offensive considering Mary-Kate's rumored connection to the celebrity drug scene, not to mention Ledger's overdose on prescription drugs. The good news: they only made 12 of them, so not only were their ill-gotten earnings likely capped at $660,000, which, let's be honest, is a drop in the bucket to their nearly half billion dollar fortune, but also there's a good chance you'll never encounter one of these abominations strapped to someone's back in real life.", "Mary-Kate looks...different", "For most of their adult lives, the Olsen twins looked like younger, pint-sized versions of Cameron Diaz, but around November 2014, people began noticing just how different Mary-Kate looked compared to her younger self and her fraternal twin sister. Naturally, the plastic surgery rumors flew, with some gossip sites even claiming Ashley had altered her appearance, too.", "In 2017, the plastic surgery chatter kicked into high gear again after the Olsens showed up to the MET Gala (above), where Mary-Kate once again bore the brunt of the speculation. It should be said, however, that the tabloid Life & Style did its best approximation of due diligence when it consulted with a plastic surgeon (who hadn't treated either twin) about possible work Mary-Kate had done. His conclusion? Smoking and/or bad makeup and lighting is to blame for her gaunt face. Mystery solved.", "The ladies rarely talk about their personal lives and have certainly not fielded questions about cosmetic surgery, but don't worry, because unethical plastic surgeons who are willing to speculate on patients they've never treated just to get their name mentioned in a national publication are never in short supply.", "Olsens to Paltrow: 'Hold our beer'", "The Olsen twins were asked by Elle to recommend some Christmas gift ideas in 2014. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they exclusively suggested items from their boutique Los Angeles shop, The Row. The real shock came with the sticker prices on some of the items, or more accurately, the lack of prices, since everything was listed as \"price upon request,\" whatever that means. (Expensive. It means very expensive.)", "Exactly how much do the Olsen twins expect someone to pay for a rare Van Cleef lighter or a deck of vintage playing cards? We'll probably never know, but we feel that we should point out that versions of both of those things can be purchased at virtually any convenience store for around $1.", "Are the items in their shop actually worth their mysterious, but surely exorbitant prices, or are the Olsen twins just trying to give Gwyneth Paltrow and her Annual GOOP Gift Guide — with its similarly market-priced personal submarine — a run for its money?", "Fuller House remains one pair shy", "Portraying Michelle Tanner on Full House was undeniably the starting point for all of the Olsen twins' fame, but when the cast signed on to be in the sequel series, Fuller House, the Olsen twins were the only ones to decline. While it's understandable that they want to take their lives in a different direction, it doesn't seem too much to ask for the Olsens to at least make a cameo as a nod to the fans and co-stars that cemented their lives of leisure and luxury.", "The reclusive duo did sort of share its reasons for skipping the reunion. According to show producer Bob Boyett, \"Ashley said, 'I have not been in front of a camera since I was 17, and I don't feel comfortable acting,'\" and \"Mary-Kate said, It would have to be me because Ash doesn't want to do it. But the timing is so bad for us.\"", "Amazingly, Full House and Fuller House creator Jeff Franklin doesn't consider the snub a burned bridge, although he did tell Us Weekly that after three years of rebuffed invitations to join the show, he's done asking. \"But when somebody rings a doorbell, the girls yell, 'It's always open!' on the show,\" Franklin said, adding, \"So that's kind of how we feel about the Olsen twins. The door is open.\"", "Elizabeth Olsen is no long lost twin", "Actress Elizabeth Olsen took a bit longer than her older sisters to breakout as an actress — 21 years to be exact. But taking time before diving into the acting world isn't the only difference between Elizabeth and the twins.", "Where Mary-Kate and Ashley are reclusive and cagey, Elizabeth is outgoing, vivacious, and comes off like an extremely well-adjusted regular person who just happens to act really, really well. Baby sister's resume also creates a significant difference between her and her sisters. Elizabeth never dabbled in cheesy tween fare.

How do coffee runs, data entry, or making photocopies educate students who are volunteering their time to learn about fashion design?", "According to court documents obtained by Radar, the twins tried to reach a confidential settlement with the plaintiffs, which would have ostensibly allowed them to avoid the publicity of a trial and the additional shady dealings it may uncover. But in March of 2017, the terms of the settlement were made public, and the Olsen twins agreed to pay $140,000 to the approximately \"180 present and past interns\" who were eligible, according to E!

In communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. On Memorial Day, some people observe the national one-minute Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by Congress in 2000. Observation of the Moment is left up to participating organizations, such as Amtrak and Major League Baseball. And, as in the U.K. and Canada, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) distributes poppies on Veterans Day and Memorial Day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. The numbers don’t lie, though: according to the VFW, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the U.S. (population: 316 million) this year. By comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the U.K. (population: 64 million) for Armistice Day, according to The Royal British Legion. Why doesn’t the United States have a common culture of commemoration? One potential explanation lies in the fact that the U.S. hasn’t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the First and Second World Wars brought to Britain and Russia, respectively. Britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the Great War, resulting in a \"lost generation.\" Jay Winter of Yale University told me that those men \"left behind ... a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn’t there.\" The Soviet Union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the Second World War—amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population. By comparison, U.S. losses in the Second World War constituted about 0.3 percent of the population, and 0.1 percent in the First World War. The only American war that incurred such steep losses was the Civil War, in which 2 percent of the population perished. It should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of Decoration Day, the precursor of Memorial Day.", "Differences in how military holidays are observed can’t be reduced to a numbers game, though. In the United States, at least, they may also stem from a strain of American thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost. Lindsey Tepe of the New America Foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view American history as \"a sweeping tale filled with ... grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and those who recognize that \"American history is also full of inconvenient truths ... and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation.\" Winter argues that \"what makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in American narratives of war.\" In the U.K., on the other hand, \"the absence of the Lost Generation mattered more.\" When America’s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn’t come home from battle. \"What makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war.\" The finer details make a difference as well. Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the VFW, believes the All-Volunteer Force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population. During the Second World War, the United States fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million. Today, the professional military is well below its troop level during World War II, and the U.S. population has more than doubled in the interim. Davis also cited as a factor the shifting of Memorial Day from its original, fixed date of May 30 to the last Monday of May. \"When you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day,\" Davis told me. Whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate America’s war casualties has been noted. From 1989 until his passing in 2012, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent. Separately, two bills have been introduced in Congress in the last two years alone—one to establish two minutes of silence on Veterans Day, the other to do the same on Memorial Day. Neither bill has been passed, although the one for Veterans Day has since been revised as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The timing of these bills is opportune. Judging by recent polls, the American public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were failures. A debate is also underway about what America’s global role should be, with many Americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular U.S. foreign policy following ISIS’s beheading of American journalists). In this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which Americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world—and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement."], "targetTitle": "Is There a Better Way to Observe Veterans Day?", "targetDescription": "Other countries offer models for truly nationwide tributes to military service and sacrifice.", "targetKeywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "targetMedia": ["http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.23.6--NS/0", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6463921&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1407501962855831&ev=NoScript", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-906344h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/11/RTR4DOTE/lead_large.jpg", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/11/RTR4DOTE/lead_large.jpg?1430150302", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-b0K-eQJGBXxXE.gif", "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2013/11/veteranlarge/a682ac40a.jpg", "http://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.22--NS/0", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/authors/d/edward-delman/headshot/headshot.jpg?1431456352"], "targetUrl": "http://theatln.tc/1qCr2IQ", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Yes.", "spoilerPublisher": "SavedYouAClick"}, "spoiler": ["Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date—and, by proxy, its original intent"], "spoilerPositions": [[[1, 2198], [1, 2370]]], "tags": ["passage"]}

That is especially true of the relatively rare blue whale, the world’s largest inhabitant.", "Decimated by historic whaling practices, blue whales number just 5,000–12,000 individuals worldwide, and they are threatened by entanglement in fishing nets, environmental noise and pollution. Scientists have long used whale blubber as a record of the chemicals that these enormous creatures absorb as they traverse the ocean. But analysis of blubber does not indicate when chemical contamination occurred, or how long it lasted.", "The whale earplug from a blue whale that was used in the study.", "Whale earwax is a fat-rich deposit that stores the same chemical data as blubber. But it also records time — similarly to the rings of a tree, the wax is laid down in light and dark bands, with each band correlating roughly to a six-month period. In baleen, or filter-feeding, whales, earwax forms a solid plug that may be tens of centimetres long and remains intact even after its death.", "Chemical signatures", "Usenko and his team identified their specimen as a male aged about 12 years. During his brief life he came into contact with 16 persistent organic pollutants, including pesticides and flame retardants. Exposure to the most persistent chemicals was greatest in the first year — and accounted for one-fifth of his total lifetime contact — suggesting a transfer of contaminants from his mother in the womb and during nursing.", "Maternal transfer of pollutants is known to happen in other mammals, such as seals and humans. Once these compounds enter the food chain, they are passed on and accumulate. \"Some of these chemicals are no longer in use, such as flame retardants that were outlawed in 2005, but they can stick around for 50 or 60 years,\" says Usenko. Other toxins uncovered from the earwax were probably picked up along the way. Mercury — which can cause brain damage — spiked twice in the sample, at around five and ten years.", "Over the whale’s life, concentrations of cortisol, a stress hormone, doubled. The peak was directly after the whale reached sexual maturity, at about ten years old, suggesting stress from sexual competition. But it is unclear whether the overall increase was caused by natural events, such as weaning, or by human activities, such as pollution and noise.", "The research is \"exciting\", says Jeremy Goldbogen, a marine biologist at Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia, Washington, but \"the inability to distinguish baseline stress levels from those associated with anthropogenic disturbances is a limitation of the study.\"", "The male blue whale whose earplug was harvested for the study.

In fact, Trump would often point to early polling from Nevada that showed him beating his rivals decisively with Hispanics, which is what happened.", "Trump has a theory. He thinks that Hispanics know that he will create jobs and that many of these jobs will go to Hispanics because his years in business have taught him that Hispanics are especially hard workers.", "The other person who saw this coming was me. Two weeks ago, I wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of \"Latinos for Trump.\" That piece was criticized by everyone from white Democrats to Latino activists to Republicans supported other candidates.", "Now, if you look at the entrance polls out of Nevada, it seems clear that these critics don’t know much about Latinos.", "Granted, these surveys are not the definitive final word. This was a small sample of voters, and many polling experts doubt the accuracy of entrance polls. Besides, we are talking about just Latino Republicans who went to vote on a given day in the state of Nevada. That’s hardly a representative sample of Latinos across the country.", "And, finally, it is worth noting, most Latinos weren’t even on the table for Republicans in Nevada because more than two-thirds of the community are registered Democrats. In fact, if Trump is ultimately the Republican nominee, it will almost assure a Latino landslide for Hillary Clinton, who could walk away with as much as 80 percent of the Latino vote.", "Still, all those caveats and conditions don’t change what happened in Nevada, or its significance. We need to unpack that.", "But first, let me explain a few things about my tribe. The 54 million Latinos in the United States—whose ancestors can be traced to more than a dozen countries—could yield an estimated 13 million voters in November. And many of those voters will be in three battleground states—Nevada, Colorado, and Florida.", "Next, there is no suspense as to which party will scoop up the lion’s share of those votes. It’s the same party that has won the majority of Latino votes in every presidential election since 1960: The Democratic Party. No Republican presidential candidate has ever won the majority of Latino votes.", "Finally, while many in Washington will often try to compare Latinos with African-Americans as another aggrieved minority that has endured everything from inferior schools to overt discrimination to economic inequality, there is a competing line of thought that suggests Latinos are more comparable to other Catholic immigrant groups, like the Irish and Italians.", "Like their European immigrant brethren, Latinos want to come to their ethnicity on their own terms. They are fiercely patriotic Americans who nonetheless identify as Latino. And they don’t feel as if they must choose one over the other.", "That is relevant to this discussion because, as one reader put it to me recently: \"If these voters think like Americans, they’ll vote for Trump. If they think like Latinos, they won’t.\"", "Now, here’s what happened in Nevada. The Latino community in the United States—and especially the nearly 70 percent of that population that is Mexican or Mexican-American—is highly aspirational. They don’t settle. They want better lives for themselves and their children. They want success. They don’t hate Trump. They want to be Trump.", "In states like Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Utah, and others, far away from the nation’s power triangle (New York-Boston-Washington), there were many average Latinos living ordinary lives who are being drawn to Trump and his promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" Like many other Americans who are flocking to the real estate mogul, these Latinos want to know what it’s like to live in a country that is always winning and winning.", "And what about Trump’s inflammatory comments about Mexico and immigration along our southern border?", "It’s complicated. While generally more appreciative than other Americans of immigration, respectful of the contributions of legal and illegal immigrants, and supportive of a comprehensive reform plan that provides the undocumented with a path to earned legal status, many Latinos are also ambivalent about illegal immigration—especially if they, or their ancestors, came legally.", "They’re leery of immigrants who abuse the system and feel entitled to make demands of the country that took them in, while waving the flag of the country that cast them adrift. They’re also fed up with what they see as a new militancy among the undocumented immigrants of today—particularly young DREAM’ers who were brought here as children and seem to understand everything about this country except what it demands of its citizens and those who aspire to be citizens.", "Like Trump, these Latino voters know something is wrong with the nation’s immigration system. They might not agree with his proposed solutions, but they’re not going to hold against him the fact that he’s brave enough to start the discussion. Besides, when Trump blasts Mexican immigrants as criminals, many Latinos just assume he’s talking about someone else.", "Meanwhile, we shouldn’t be terribly surprised that the chattering class completely missed the \"Latinos for Trump\" story. Much of it fell into their blind spot.", "The East Coast media don’t get Latinos. Neither do the political parties. Ditto for most commentators, pundits, and political strategists.

But only just. What does it mean and should those opposed to Trump be worried?", "The polling data site RealClearPolitics (RCP) takes an average of national polls that ask Americans who they would choose in a contest between the two candidates (a scenario that now looks inevitable). On Sunday, RCP updated their numbers to show that Trump is now, on average, 0.2 percentage points ahead of Clinton.", "That gap might be narrow, but it has still led some (including a senior elections analyst at RCP) to conclude \"it’s probably time to panic\". I’d disagree. For those concerned about the prospect of a Trump victory, it’s been time to panic for a while – zooming out from a single statistic shows it.", "Delayed panic?", "Although this might be the first time that Trump has come out on top in the RCP polling average, he has come very close to doing so on two prior occasions – in September and December of last year. Since September, Clinton’s lead has fluctuated significantly from being as large as 11 percentage points to as narrow as 0.6. In other words, there have been many other periods when Trump’s opponents should have been worrying before now.", "Just as it took pundits a while to wake up to the fact that Trump was a sufficiently popular candidate to win the Republican nomination, it seems that they have also been slow to switch focus to his chances of winning the White House.", "Part of the reason why they didn’t panic before was a belief that measuring American public opinion a long time before a national election is a bad predictor of voting patterns. Why? Because people change their minds. November is still six months away. The alternative view is that preferences may be becoming hardened now, making voter behavior less likely to shift.", "Looking backward, rather than forward, results from the last six presidential elections suggest that 31 states are \"safe\" – based on the fact that the same party has consistently won them. Unsurprisingly, polling companies are investing their time and resources in states they think might \"swing\" and therefore determine electoral outcomes nationally – states like Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. So far, polling suggests neither candidate has a significant lead in those states which could provide extra cause for concern for those worrying about a Trump win.", "Polling on a pedestal", "All that said, the RCP polling average is not the perfect political barometer it is so often held up to be.", "The polling average has become the go-to number for those trying to make quick sense of the state of the presidential race. That’s problematic in itself; this election can’t be predicted on the basis of just one number, not least because a candidate’s vote share does not neatly translate to their chances of winning the White House. Each state wields a different number of electoral votes, so it matters how a candidate’s support is distributed throughout the country.", "Democratic victories in highly populous states, which have more electoral votes to award, could cause the performance of the Democratic candidate in the electoral college to outstrip her or his performance in the popular vote. In 2008, Barack Obama won 68% of the electoral college vote with only 53% of the popular vote. Clinton may be buoyed in the 2016 election cycle by traditional Democratic strength in populous states such as New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California.", "There’s another, much bigger problem with the RCP average, though: it’s only as good as the individual polls that make it up. RCP always takes a straight average of the five most recent polls that were conducted. Once you peek under the hood, you’ll see that an average of 0.2 percentage points flattens out some very different findings. These are the five latest polls RCP used to calculate Trump’s narrow lead:", "ABC News/Washington Post: Trump leads by 2 percentage points", "NBC News/Wall Street Journal: Clinton leads by 3 percentage points", "Rasmussen Reports: Trump leads by 5 percentage points", "FOX News: Trump leads by 3 percentage points", "CBS News/New York Times: Clinton leads by 6 percentage points", "These polls have different results in part because they use different methodologies for assessing public opinion. Although they were all conducted during a relatively similar period of time (which is essential when trying to get a snapshot of what the public thinks now), the polls by NBC/WSJ and Fox News only spoke to registered voters, Rasmussen interviewed \"likely voters\", while the ABC News/Washington Post poll simply spoke to adults (82% of whom were registered voters).", "All polls claim to speak to a \"nationally representative\" sample of adults, but virtually none will publish data showing where their respondents were based. Perhaps Rasmussen Reports had to adjust their findings to account for the fact that they only managed to speak to two people in Iowa – we just don’t know. Languages matter too. Two of the polls mentioned above conducted their interviews in Spanish and English – it seems that the others did not.", "Methodologies matter. They’re one reason why the footnotes in each poll mention slightly different degrees of accuracy. Take the ABC News/Washington Post poll for example – those numbers have a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points. That means that Trump’s reported lead of 2 percentage points could have actually been as high as 5.5 percentage points. Or it could be that Hillary Clinton actually led by 1.5 percentage points.", "Polling is far from perfect.

It was written by Jack Norworth, who had a successful career in show business starring on Broadway in the early 1900s before also appearing in several sound films.", "THE MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS", "The origins of the seventh inning stretch are lost to the shadows of history. One popular story dates back to the days of President William Howard Taft, who was attending a game in 1910 and stood up during the middle of the seventh inning to stretch his legs. Naturally (the story goes) when all of the other fans in attendance saw Taft stand, they followed suit.", "Another theory about the tradition's origins cites an 1869 issue of the New York Herald, which documented a game in which the entire crowd simply stood up after a brutally long second inning of play, thus inventing \"the stretch\" (albeit a bit earlier in the game).

La Russa believes that the stretch helps to remind players and fans of the game's roots, which is especially valuable even as other things change, such as the structure of the playoffs or the addition of instant replay.", "THE RELIEF", "Baseball is physically and mentally grueling. The lack of a game clock, the open-ended nature of every game, its division into turn-based innings rather than periods or quarters -- all these elements contribute to baseball's unique flow. The 162 games of the regular season are played over about 185 days, plus the seven weeks of spring training and the playoffs. During the season, players work daily on their physical conditioning in the weight room, batting cage or bullpen, and they are constantly reviewing video for tendencies.", "Ichiro Suzuki, the New York Yankees outfielder and future Hall of Famer, told The Huffington Post a few weeks ago that he took a mere three days off after his 13th season before resuming hitting duties.", "And the games themselves may be getting longer, making the seventh inning stretch even more of necessity for players. According to MLB.com, the average time for a nine-inning game in the 1970s was around two hours and 30 minutes. During the 2000s however, that time had increased by a full 20 minutes. This past season, the average game time tied the all-time high of two hours, 58 minutes.

But despite prose that shades purple to today's ears, Bly's work holds up not only for its daring, but for its impact: It prompted a grand jury investigation that led to changes she'd proposed, including a $26 million (in today's dollars) increase to the budget of the city's Department of Public Charities and Correction and regulations to ensure that only the seriously mentally ill were committed.", "Access to prisons has been vastly curtailed. There is no way to know what truly happens inside but to go there.", "Bly—who'd go on to get herself arrested so she could investigate conditions at a women's prison, and to best Jules Verne's fictional protagonist by circumnavigating the world in 72 days—was not the first journalist to go inside an institution to expose its inner workings. Or the last. Ted Conover also reported from behind prison walls, as did Ben Bagdikian, for whom MoJo's fellowship program is named. In 1961, John Howard Griffin ingested a chemical that darkened his skin to investigate racial apartheid in the United States. Barbara Ehrenreich took jobs at chain restaurants and Walmart to spotlight the plight of low-wage workers. Mac McClelland worked as a picker in a warehouse of an online shipping behemoth to report for Mother Jones.", "But while such investigations were commonplace in the muckraker era, they've grown increasingly rare. Why? First, there's a real concern over ethics. When is it okay for reporters to not announce themselves as such? There's no governing body of journalism, but a checklist written by Poynter ethicist Bob Steele provides guidelines for assessing when this kind of reporting is acceptable. I'll paraphrase:", "When the information obtained is of vital public interest.", "When other efforts to gain that information have been exhausted.", "When the journalist is willing to disclose the reason and nature of any deception.", "When the news organization applies the skill, time, and funding needed to fully pursue the story.", "When the harm prevented outweighs any harm caused.", "After meaningful deliberation of the ethical and legal issues.", "To see what private prisons are really like, Shane Bauer applied for a job with the Corrections Corporation of America. He used his own name and Social Security number, and he noted his employment with the Foundation for National Progress, the publisher of Mother Jones. He did not lie. He spent four months as a guard at a CCA-run Louisiana prison, and then we spent 14 more months reporting and fact-checking.", "We took these extraordinary steps because press access to prisons and jails has been vastly curtailed in recent decades, even as inmates have seen their ability to sue prisons—often the only way potential abuses would pop up on the radar of news organizations or advocates—dramatically reduced. There is no other way to know what truly happens inside but to go there.", "But here's the other reason investigations like this one have grown so rare: litigation. When ABC News busted Food Lion for repackaging spoiled meat for sale back in 1992, a jury bought the company's line that the real offense had been the falsification of employment applications and the reporters' failure to fulfill their assigned duties—i.e., repackaging spoiled meat! The $5.5 million damage award was eventually knocked down to just two dollars, but it put a chill on this kind of muckraking for a generation, and during that time, corporate and official entities built an ever-tighter web of legal protections. Nondisclosure agreements—once mainly the provenance of people who work on Apple product launches and Beyoncé videos—are now seeping into jobs of all stripes, where they commingle with various other \"non-disparagement\" clauses and \"employer protection statutes.\" Somewhere along the way, employers' legitimate interest in protecting hard-won trade secrets has turned into an all-purpose tool for shutting down public scrutiny—even when the organizations involved are more powerful than agencies of government.", "Companies' interest in protecting trade secrets has turned into a tool for shutting down public scrutiny.", "Or when, for that matter, they replace the government. When CCA (which runs 61 prisons, jails, and detention centers on behalf of US taxpayers) learned about our investigation, it sent us a four-page letter warning that Shane had \"knowingly and deliberately breached his duty to CCA by violating its policies,\" and that there could be all manner of legal consequences. The letter came not from CCA's in-house counsel, but from the same law firm that had represented a billionaire megadonor in his three-year quest to punish us for reporting on his anti-LGBT activities. When he lost, he pledged $1 million to support others who might want to sue us, and, though we won the case, were it not for the support of our readers the out-of-pocket costs would have hobbled us.", "Shane's story will draw a fair bit of curiosity around the newsgathering methods employed. But don't let anyone distract you from the story itself. Because the story itself is revealing as hell.", "If you think stories like this need to be told, please make a tax-deductible donation to Mother Jones to help underwrite our investigations."], "targetTitle": "Why We Sent a Reporter to Work as a Private Prison Guard", "targetDescription": null, "targetKeywords": "Corporations,Crime+and+Justice,Investigations,Prisons,Top+Stories", "targetMedia": ["http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/941756981/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "http://motherjones.com/sites/all/assets/MJ_comp.png", "http://www.motherjones.com/files/edletter_2000x1124.png", "http://www.motherjones.com/files/imagecache/top-of-content-image/edletter_2000x1124.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-Be0QSW1bbb6Qv.gif", "http://adserver.adtechus.com/adserv|3.0|5443.1|4170840|0|529|ADTECH;loc=300;key=key1+key2+key3+key4;alias=", "http://www.motherjones.com/files/imagecache/imagecache-300x169/cca_tower-close_2000.jpg", "http://www.motherjones.com/files/imagecache/imagecache-300x169/414_cca4_d.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8027488&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://www.motherjones.com/files/imagecache/imagecache-300x169/414_cca3_a.jpg", "http://www.motherjones.com/files/imagecache/imagecache-300x169/master_cca.jpg", "http://www.motherjones.com/files/imagecache/author-thumb-80x80/photo/jefferyclara-web100.jpg", "http://motherjones.com/sites/all/assets/MJ_comp_grey.png"], "targetUrl": "http://motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-private-prisons-investigative-journalism-editors-note", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "To see what private prisons are like", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["Access to prisons has been vastly curtailed.

Some consumers were crossing things off the list before back-to-school shopping even wrapped up.", "Erin Dunphy, 25, started her holiday shopping this summer. She says it’s better for her wallet, and starting early better accommodates her work schedule.", "\"It really helps to spread out the spending that I want to do and really start to look at the things or experiences I want to give to others,\" says Erin. \"Also, August through February is my busiest time at work. So I make sure I try to cross things off my list early in the process.\"", "Erin also uses shopping early as a way to stick to a budget. She puts away money for the holidays well in advance, which guarantees she isn’t draining her bank account as the holidays approach. It also spaces out her spending, and ensures she’s not paying sizeable holiday markups on her purchases.", "\"I start saving early so I have a little stash that I know is for others. Buying now means if something goes wrong, I can pay for it all and not feel like I have to choose between [buying] presents or fixing my car if it were to break,\" she says.", "While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Rubicon Project While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Holiday Consumer Pulse survey , millennials are one of the primary groups controlling holiday spending this year. The Rubicon survey reports that millennials are predicted to spend an average of $1,427 in 2016, up from the $1,072 they spent last year. This is based off 1,003 interviews Rubicon conducted in late August 2016.", "Erin says she can see herself spending close to the millennial average by the time she’s completed her shopping. She shops for her immediate family, her fiancé, her fiancé’s parents and her two best friends.", "\"For the parents, nana and brother, my fiancé and I usually split the cost which helps tremendously. Right now I have all the friend presents, my mom’s present and I know what I’m getting for everyone,\" says Erin. \"My fiancé and I are going to Hawaii on our honeymoon, so we’re getting each other an experience while we’re there, that’s the only one I’m really waiting on.\"", "Millennials aren’t the only ones controlling holiday shopping this year. Their spending still comes second to parents (though these two categories overlap). Parents plan to spend an average of more than $1,700 this holiday season. Not only is this about $300 more than they spent in 2015 (the average was $1,383 last year), but it’s also substantially more than the $903 non-parents plan to spend.", "Parents are predicted to spend $495 per child this year, which is nearly $100 more than they spent last year. However, there is a discrepancy between how much each parent spends. Male parents plan to spend slightly more per child. The survey results for millennials and parents also revealed that more than half plan to buy a gift for themselves.

The bad news is that it involves women pretending that they are men.", "In a column in the Wall Street Journal, John Greathouse of Rincon Venture Partners outlined his belief that women will get more opportunities in tech if they \"create an online presence that obscures their gender.\" Bizarrely equating hiring practices in tech to blind orchestra auditions, Greathouse suggested that women do things like only use their first initial and eliminate photos on both Twitter and LinkedIn. Rather than call on tech companies to overcome the unconscious bias that can too easily be baked into hiring practices, Greathouse thinks women should solve the problem themselves by hiding who they really are.", "\"[The column] made me really mad.\" said Angela Dalton , a managing director at Guggenheim. \"It’s wrong on so many levels. It perpetuates the trap that women fall into that if I put my head down and just work, I will get noticed... Success is competency, yes, but it’s also personality and warmth.\"", "I sat down with Dalton as well as three other female investors for a panel discussion today at TAP , a tech conference in New York. The topic of our chat was the future of mobile investing, but with the industry abuzz with disbelief about the column, our conversation inevitably changed direction. [Greathouse did not respond to an email I sent him requesting comment. In a tweet, he apologized for the column.]", "Heidi Roizen , an operating partner at DFJ, said that when she started in venture capital, she was routinely the only woman in the room. After becoming aware of the gender bias that pervades the tech industry, Roizen decided to give her two children gender-neutral names. That way when their applied to jobs later in life, the recruiter wouldn’t know if they were male or female.", "\"This is sad, but it is also true,\" said Roizen. \"Yes we did to change things, but we need to recognize the reality for what it is.\"", "Nimi Katragadda , a principal at BoxGroup, agreed with Roizen that you can’t ignore the problem, but said that hiding your identity entirely to overcome bias was \"asinine’ advice.", "\"Why should you hide your identity because the person on the other end of the table is backwards?\" she said. \"You are making the problem worse that way.\"", "The fact that all the investors on stage for my panel were women was not an accident. In fact, the conference organizers were trying to combat the gender gap in tech by doing the exact opposite of what Greathouse suggested. After having a difficult time recruiting female speakers for last year’s conference -- a problem that plagues most tech events -- the organizers intentionally set out with the goal of having more than 50% female speakers. Highlighting female voices was the conference’s way of signaling to leaders in the room that diversity in leadership roles should be a priority.", "\"We know that companies that have diverse teams do better,\" said Susanne Greenfield , a Director at Priceline Group. \"But there is this unconscious bias. People want to hire and promote people who are similar to them. You have to do something to fight that bias.\"", "As a LinkedIn editor, I regularly work with thought leaders in tech who share their insights on our publishing platform. Rather than encourage female writers to mask their identity and experiences, I suggest they own it. In order to combat the misguided notion that the tech industry is only comprised of male leaders, women must share their expertise on social networks so that audiences hear a diverse set of perspectives. To get more women interested in pursuing careers in technology, current female leaders must continue to strive to be seen, rather than hide like Greathouse suggests."], "targetTitle": "This 'sad' advice a male VC just gave to women in tech couldn't be more wrong", "targetDescription": null, "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://archive.is/P8f03/ec47a337d1856ccf914269a1e6aeb01175d51483/scr.png", "http://archive.is/P8f03/a8013950eb57ddcde2b6fb016b645dcdd15065be.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,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", "http://archive.is/P8f03/c37694c12704fb5f281fa6b0a45ee986a7d0f702.jpg", "http://archive.is/P8f03/0e2b720788b240c7fcd0cae5ba9c0e4abab43976.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="], "targetUrl": "http://archive.is/P8f03", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "The advice is to obscure your gender in your online presence", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["pretending that they are men"], "spoilerPositions": [[[0, 161], [0, 189]]], "tags": ["phrase"]}
{"uuid": "eafcd66b-c45f-4aaf-81d1-e16fb5e7bf7a", "postId": "4ttv4g", "postText": ["8 things that will be more expensive next month"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["1. Cold-Weather Clothing © Provided by Gobankingrates cold weather clothing expensive In July, the cold-weather months seem far away, but as we get into August and to the back-to-school and holiday season, stores start to put out fall merchandise. This means the prices on items like warm coats, long pants, boots and sweaters will be at their highest during this month. You might find back-to-school sales on some of these items, but you won’t find any deep discounts like you can during other months. A great way to save money on clothing all year is to shop during the off-season. For example, look for discounts on cold-weather clothing during the spring and early summer months, and purchase your summer gear during August and September, according to Consumer Reports. Another tip to shopping in the off-season is to always keep your receipts. The discounts on off-season clothing can increase quickly and dramatically, and stores like Target, Sears and Kmart have price-match policies for anywhere from 14 to 30 days after purchase.", "2. Back-to-School Supplies", "© Provided by Gobankingrates back to school supplies expensive Not surprisingly, August is a big month for back-to-school shopping. Sales on school supplies are easy to find, but the prices might not be as low compared to other months. Since retailers know consumers are looking for sales on school supplies during August, it’s not uncommon for them to stock up on lots of shiny new things that are more expensive than your traditional supplies. Shelves will be stocked with inexpensive \"loss leaders,\" like pencils and paper to get you in the door. But retailers count on you to also purchase full-priced items with high profit margins — like binders, graph paper and computer memory sticks, according to Time.com. It’s an exciting time for kids, and it’s easy to get tempted into buying all the new things. Consider keeping a stock of basic and inexpensive school supplies, like paper, pens, pencils and binders to get you through the first few weeks of school. Wait to buy the rest of your school supplies in September, which is typically the best month to score rock-bottom prices on this stuff.", "3. Theme Park Tickets © Provided by Gobankingrates theme park tickets expensive The summer season is an ideal time for a family to The summer season is an ideal time for a family to head to a popular theme park , but ticket prices are at their highest during these months. Typically, theme parks are the most crowded when kids are out of school, through late August, during the week of Thanksgiving, over the winter holidays and during spring break season. Because the demand is so high, these businesses charge the most they can for entrance to the park, according to Nasdaq.com. Not only does this put a major dent in your wallet, but it can also increase how much time you have to wait to go on a ride. So you’re paying top-dollar to visit the park, but getting less value because you have to spend so much time waiting to see the attractions. Dave Shute, co-author of \"The Easy Guide to Your First Walt Disney World Visit\" recommended vising Disney World between the second week of Easter and the week before Memorial day, mid-to-late October, any week in November other than Thanksgiving, and during December up to a week before Christmas.", "4. Patio Furniture © Provided by Gobankingrates patio furniture expensive The last full month of summer might seem like a good time to buy new patio furniture, but retailers usually wait until September to really drop prices on these goods, according to DealNews. August is still a warm month, and customers will pay full price to lounge outdoors and soak up the sun. Since you can easily spend $400 to $2,000 or more on an outdoor furniture set, according to HowMuchIsIt.org, it’s smart to wait until then, as retailers will be trying to quickly sell off the remaining goods. Keep in mind that popular stores like Sears and Home Depot might sell out of discounted outdoor furniture more quickly than a small retailer, so keep your eye out for deals starting at the end of August, according to personal finance advice website SmartAsset. But if you buy before Labor Day, you’ll likely pay more than you would later, according to CBS News.", "5. Televisions © Provided by Gobankingrates televisions expensive Deals on televisions are usually scarce during the summer months, and prices are still high on HDTVs in August. Prices do start to drop in the fall, as the summer comes to a close and the holiday season starts to ramp up. If you need to purchase a new TV before the prime season, DealNews recommended looking for a name-brand 55-inch TV or larger for around $500, although you might be able to save around $100 by going for an off-brand. Also, college students who want to upgrade the TVs or LCDs in their rooms should wait until school has been in session for at least a few weeks to score better prices.", "6. iPhones and iPads © Provided by Gobankingrates iphones ipads expensive August is a terrible time to August is a terrible time to upgrade your Apple devices because the company usually unveils their upcoming models in September or October, reported DealNews. This means the price on an Apple device purchased in August will immediately begin to lose value in the coming weeks and months. If you’re in the market for a new iPhone or iPad, either purchase it earlier in the summer or wait for deals on older models in the fall.", "7. Bicycles © Provided by Gobankingrates bicycles expensive August is plenty warm enough to still enjoy outdoor cycling, so it’s typically a bad month to invest in a new bicycle. If you can wait, prices start to drop closer to the fall, with discounts starting in August and lasting through December, according to Consumer Reports. Just like car dealerships, bike shops need to make room for the new inventory toward the end of the year. So the best time to look for a rock-bottom deal is during the winter months, according to Bicycling.com. The site also recommended avoiding models that are more than a few years old, even if they are deeply discounted. Advances in cycling technology change so quickly that a \"great deal\" might actually just be an average one if you can get a far superior model for just a little bit more money."], "targetTitle": "8

Historically, white women have had the highest breast cancer incidence rates among women aged 40 years and older, and they still do with about 127 cases per 100,000 compared with 118 cases per 100,000 black women. However, incidence rates are now converging among white and African-American women, particularly among those aged 50 years to 59 years. \"Although the incidence haven't declined, we have made strides in the effort to improve the survival rate. Death rates have declined by 34 percent since 1990. However, not all ethnic groups are enjoying this improved survival,\" Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told HealthDay . Breast cancer death rates have dropped by 34 percent since 1990 in all racial/ethnic groups except American Indians/Alaska Natives, while African-American women continue to have the poorest breast cancer survival of any racial/ethnic group. In June, a JAMA study showed that black women are less likely to survive a breast cancer diagnosis within five years because they undergo fewer screenings, have poorer health at the time of diagnosis and have more advanced disease by the time the cancer is found.

The films made by Marvel Studios are arguably best known for it, but fun stingers have also been found in the \"X-Men\" franchise movies as well as the latest \"Terminator.\" Because of this, some have wondered if this could be something new for the \"Star Wars\" series as well... but now J.J. Abrams has definitely put an end to that conversation.", "The subject came up when Abrams was on stage for a \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" press conference held today in Los Angeles. The filmmaker was directly asked if fans can expect to see a post-credits scene or Easter Egg at the end of the sequel, and he quickly dismissed the idea, saying:", "\"No, there’s not. All the scenes are actually in the movie.\"", "Those of you who have been following updates and stories about \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" for a while will note that this dispels a rumor that has been going around for the last few months. Back in September it was rumored that the latest saga film would actually be teasing the first \"Star Wars\" story, \"Rogue One.\" This made a degree of sense, given that the Gareth Edwards-directed feature has been filming since this past summer, and will surely have a good amount of footage ready by the time \"Force Awakens\" arrives in theaters. Now it sounds like that post-credits scene definitely isn’t happening – so instead maybe we can just expect the blockbuster to come with a trailer for the eighth live-action \"Star Wars\" movie during the coming attractions.", "Post-credits scenes are definitely fun for fans, and a good incentive to get people to stick around and watch the credits – but I can’t say that I’m too upset that \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" won’t have one. After all, they aren’t exactly part of the franchise’s tradition (none of the previous movies have stingers), and it’s not a device that has to be used all over Hollywood. If everything the movie has to say can be fit between the opening scrawl and the end credits, more power to it.", "Surely there will be some fans who will be disappointed by this news, but hopefully they’ll all get over it fairly quickly. After all, the feelings about the lack of a post-credits scene should be drowned out by the excitement that comes with the fact that we’re now less than two weeks away from the theatrical release of \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" As always, stay tuned for more about the movie, including our on-camera interviews with the cast and J.J.

That’s the one!’\" said Gieselman, who frequently ends sentences with a gentle laugh. \"Before, it had been really difficult to explain how I was feeling to other people, and even really difficult to explain it in my own head. Suddenly, there was a language for it, and that started the journey.\"", "Gieselman dumped the girlie name bestowed at birth, asked friends and teachers to use Rocko, the tough-sounding nickname friends had come up with, and told people to use \"they\" instead of \"he\" or \"she.\" \"They\" has become an increasingly popular substitute for \"he\" or \"she\" in the transgender community, and the University of Vermont, a public institution of some 12,700 students, has agreed to use it.", "While colleges across the country have been grappling with concerns related to students transitioning from one gender to another, Vermont is at the forefront in recognizing the next step in identity politics: the validation of a third gender.", "The university allows students like Gieselman to select their own identity — a new first name, regardless of whether they’ve legally changed it, as well as a chosen pronoun — and records these details in the campuswide information system so that professors have the correct terminology at their fingertips.", "For years, writers and academics have argued that gender identity is not a male/female binary but a continuum along which any individual may fall, depending on a variety of factors, including anatomy, chromosomes, hormones and feelings. But the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activists had been focused mainly on expanding the definitions of the two pre-existing categories.", "Today, a growing number of students are embracing the idea that when it comes to classifying gender, there should be more than two options — something now afforded by the dating website OkCupid and by Facebook, which last year added a tab for \"custom\" alongside \"male\" and \"female,\" with some 50 options, including \"agender,\" \"androgyne,\" \"pangender\" and \"trans person,\" as well as an option for controlling who can see the customized version.", "Activists on campuses as diverse as Penn State, University at Albany, University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and University of California, Riverside, are laying claim to a degree of identity freedom nearly unimaginable when the first L.G.B.T student centers were established. Today’s students, who grew up with Gay-Straight Alliances in their high schools, with transgender people represented in the media and with transgender rights percolating through the courts, arrived on campuses already L.G.B.T.-friendly and, in many cases, equipped with gender-neutral housing and bathrooms.", "In hopes of raising consciousness of the biases built into social structures and into the language we use to discuss them, students are organizing identity conferences and inventing new vocabularies, which include pronouns like \"ze\" and \"xe,\" and pressing administrations to make changes that validate, in language, the existence of a gender outside the binary.", "Certainly, there’s a long line of people throughout history whose traits have put them outside norms, and some cultures long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn’t purely female or purely male, like the American Indian’s two-spirits or India’s hijras. But the binary is a belief system at least as old as Adam and Eve, and most people don’t even realize it’s there. \"It’s like a constant coming-out process, educating those around you that there is a gender binary, and this is what it means to identify outside of it,\" said Gieselman, who works on campus planning gender-related events.", "Identifying as genderqueer is an opportunity to self-invent, unburdened from social expectations about dress and behavior. Occasionally Gieselman wishes for a lower voice and flatter chest, but other times feels O.K. with, even happy about, having a feminine physique.", "\"Even within the same day or the next day I can suddenly really love how my chest looks in a sundress,\" said Gieselman, who wears two small nose rings. In the bedroom closet hang T-shirts, flannels, dresses and a rack of bow ties.", "It might seem a simple turn of events, but adding gender-neutral options to the University of Vermont’s information system took nearly a decade of lobbying, the creation of a task force of students, faculty members and administrators, and six months and $80,000 in staff time to create a software patch.", "One key to the developments is Dorothea Brauer, a plain-spoken, big-hearted mental health counselor known to everyone as Dot. Ms. Brauer spent nine years working at the campus counseling center before becoming, in 2001, the director of what was then called the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning & Ally Center.", "While in her 20s and living in New Jersey, Ms. Brauer, who wears her hair cut short with a single, long braid down her back in tribute to a Cherokee grandmother, was spending time with a woman when an acquaintance changed the course of her life by inquiring about the relationship, and then pointedly but nonjudgmentally asking, \"Honey, are you gay?\"", "\"I said, ‘Well, yeah, but only with Anita,’ \" recalled Ms. Brauer. (Anita would turn out to be her life partner — 32 years and counting.) \"That’s how clueless I was,\" she said, chuckling over a taco salad lunch at the Penny Cluse Café in downtown Burlington. \"I was 24, 25, and scared to death. I came out to my mother, only my mother, because I became physically ill with depression.\"", "A decade later, as one of the few out women on campus in the 1990s, she treated students with debilitating identity issues, some of whom attempted suicide or faced a psychotic break. (L.G.B.T.Q. youth are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Ms. Brauer’s first act upon being installed as the center’s director was to assign a graduate student to research and catalog the unmet needs of the transgender community.", "Among the difficulties faced by transgender students: inability to use bathrooms marked \"men\" or \"women\" for fear of a confrontation with a confused classmate; being accused of using a stolen student ID in the cafeteria because the name printed on it didn’t match someone’s gender appearance; and having the faculty rely on a student-information system that listed only legal names, leading to occasions when a student might be embarrassed or inadvertently outed. Ms. Brauer heard about one distraught transgender freshman whose professor, while calling roll, first read the student’s feminine legal name, then announced the male nickname.", "Ms. Brauer reached out to the registrar, Keith P. Williams, who worked with the university’s lawyers to allow transgender students to change their first name in the schoolwide system, but doing so required an in-person visit to the dean of students’ office and filling out paperwork. She then set to work waging a campaign to educate, face to face, members of the faculty, staff and administration on why language sensitivity was so important to a student’s self-respect — and assisted students in getting school policy amended to specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.", "By 2009, faculty members themselves began pushing for a broader solution to the identification issue, and Mr. Williams created a task force to look into how students could register a preferred first name without having to make a special request. The task force realized that the only way to guarantee a professor would properly refer to a student was to supply the student’s pronoun on class rosters and advisee lists. Then came the question of which gender-neutral pronoun to offer.", "\"Students proposed ‘they/them’ pronouns, but the faculty vetoed the idea because they said it is grammatically incorrect,\" Mr. Williams recalled. \"They said, ‘You don’t put a plural pronoun with a single individual.’\" A second option, also being used in various trans communities, was \"ze\" (pronounced ZEE), a riff on the German pronoun \"sie,\" with \"hir\" replacing \"his/her.\"", "Bowing to the faculty, the task force selected \"ze\" and revised its information system, becoming the first school in the nation at which students could select their pronoun. They could also leave the field blank, or opt for \"name only,\" indicating a preference for being referred to by name instead of by pronoun.", "The change fueled gender-awareness campaigns by students all over the country. So many administrators were receiving requests that, in 2012, the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers convened a task force to draft a list of best practices for handling transgender student records.", "So far, about 100 schools now allow students, and sometimes employees, to indicate a moniker other than their legal first name, according to the Consortium of Higher Education L.G.B.T Resource Professionals, and hundreds more have contacted Vermont on how to implement the pronoun choice.", "In September, the university’s pronoun options were expanded yet again to include \"they,\" as grammarians have reminded naysayers that the English language is constantly evolving. Since 2009, 1,891 University of Vermont students have specified a preferred pronoun, with 14 opting for \"ze,\" 10 for \"they\" and another 228 for name only.", "On campuses across the country gender-conscious students have adopted the earnest, P.C. practice of starting social interactions by introducing themselves by name and \"P.G.P.,\" or preferred gender pronoun. (The most semantically obsessed still object to the word \"preferred.\")", "Robyn Ochs, an educator who helped found an early L.G.B.T. faculty and staff group at Harvard, believes that Vermont’s changes are nothing less than lifesaving.", "\"Some people try to reduce this whole topic to kids trying to be cool or they’re just acting out or whatever, just trying to be different or new,\" said Ms. Ochs, who has visited some 500 campuses to speak on L.G.B.T. issues, and often facilitates a discussion she calls \"Beyond Binaries.\" \"But there have always been people who have felt profoundly uncomfortable in their assigned gender roles,\" she said. \"Anything we can do to make them safer, or make them feel recognized, heard, seen, understood, we should do. To validate their identity and experience could, in fact, save their life.\"", "How does one explain to family members what it means to be neither male nor female? Once, at age 15, in conversation with an aunt at the kitchen table, Gieselman tried unsuccessfully to diagram the concepts of gender and sex on a napkin, with gender referring to the attitudes and behaviors a society associates with a person’s biological sex, and sex referring to a person’s biological status (not to be confused with sexual orientation, one’s romantic interests). \"I don’t even know what it was I was trying to show,\" Gieselman, an eighth-generation Vermonter, recounted with a laugh. Gieselman’s grandmother, too, had a few questions about the napkin. \"They were very confused,\" Gieselman said, \"and still are.\"", "Sara Miller, Gieselman’s mother, said that when her teenager first came out to her and offered to provide a pronoun chart for reference, she scoffed.", "\"At the time, it irritated me to no end,\" said Ms. Miller, a social worker. \"I was like, ‘Really? This is what our struggle is going to be about? Pronouns?’\"", "But Ms. Miller has learned to accept the person her former little girl has become. \"It’s grown out of the process of really seeing how Rocko has grown as an individual and an adult, seeing how Rocko is their own person, and not a child,\" Ms. Miller said. \"This is how they presents themself to new friends and colleagues and employers and students. That group knows Rocko only that way.\"", "Although Ms. Miller tries her best to always use \"they/them\" pronouns, she often slips up, but Gieselman isn’t bothered. \"Rocko and I have an understanding. She knows I try,\" said Ms. Miller, slipping up again.", "At last summer’s orientation for new faculty members, Ms. Brauer handed out pocket-size pronoun charts created by the L.G.B.T. Resource Center at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. She also gave out her cellphone number and words of support: \"If you’re struggling with it, give me a call any time and I’ll walk you through it, and give you time to practice, and walk you through any questions you might have.\"", "Use of \"they/them\" is so widely accepted in the politically correct enclave that is Burlington that a colleague at Feldman’s Bagels, where Gieselman works part time, recently asked if it was O.K. to correct a customer who uses the wrong pronoun because she knew Gieselman wouldn’t.", "\"I know if something might be bothering them, they wouldn’t necessarily say something about it,\" said Alexa Ciecierski, a morning-shift co-worker.", "At the apartment that afternoon, Gieselman talked excitedly about finally receiving documentation of a legal name change, which arrived in the mail that afternoon, and showed off several gig posters brought home by a roommate, who manages local bands. On the coffee table, a collection of Angel Cards filled a small bowl, each billet offering a single word like \"discernment\" or \"balance\" or \"integrity,\" meant to be chosen and read for a daily dose of inspiration.", "\"Do you want to pick one?\" Gieselman asked me.

Bizarro looks and acts like Superman but lives by the exact reverse logic: he says adjectives to mean their opposite, he sees it as a crime to do good, and so on. There’s a great Seinfeld episode based on the character.", "In today’s age of superhero movie ubiquity, it’s tempting to read 2000’s Unbreakable as a Bizarro version of everything that proceeded it. The basic similarities are all there: a cloaked protagonist with superhuman strength locks horns with a scheming, criminally insane supervillain. We see the reluctant hero, played here by Bruce Willis, come to terms with his powers, use them for civic protection and watch him win the girl before finally overcoming his nemesis. We get both characters’ origin stories in flashback, and both are played by Hollywood A-listers. It’s the preeminent blockbuster blueprint.", "And yet it by no means and exaggeration to say that Unbreakable is the exact antithesis of Marvel and DC’s current output. For starters, it clocks in at 106 minutes and its cast barely extends beyond the four central actors. Nothing explodes, erupts or is shot at from beginning to end. There is no shouting. The film is shot and cut with a near-maddening degree of patience, its soundtrack almost noiseless for long spells, and it resorts to eye-catching CGI not once.", "It may be anathema to the box-office behemoths of today, but there’s no doubt that M Night Shyamalan’s film is a superhero movie in the truest sense. Nor that, as its camera glides affectionately down the aisles of comic-book stores drinking in vintage illustrations, it shows a genuine passion for the original form that is unmatched by anything that has come since (with the possible exception of Sam Raimi’s Spiderman films).", "The present glut of cinematic universe-forging comic-book adaptations has born some decent films and some terrible ones, but none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable. Remember the face-clawing tedium that was the final hour of Man of Steel ? Indestructible hero and indestructible villain throwing each other through brick walls ad nauseum, CGI skyscrapers reduced to CGI rubble at a rate of knots, the level of peril remaining at precisely zero throughout. Unbreakable’s final encounter includes not a single building flattened, not a single punch thrown and lasts all of five minutes. Instead, we see Willis’ David Dunn defeat his arch-nemesis by dobbing him in to the authorities. It is a scene of understated gravitas, perhaps the most affecting showdown of any modern superhero movie.", "It’s also significant that the other character at the heart of Unbreakable is Samuel L Jackson’s villain. Six years before he was being driven to high-pitched distraction by those muthafuckin’ snakes on that muthafuckin’ plane, Hollywood’s keenest scenery-stealer took to the screen with uncharacteristic restraint as embittered comic-art dealer Elijah Price, barely raising his voice above a murmur throughout (and his one concession to theatricality, the berating of a customer intending on buying a limited edition print for his kid, works as a nice metaphor for how the film wants to treats its audience like adults).", "If Heath Ledger’s Joker was so arresting because of his lack of motive, Jackson’s cane-clutching baddie chills precisely because his are so plainly stated. But while Ledger used a manic physicality to unnerve, Jackson achieves the same end through the opposite means: his resolutely undemonstrative \"Mr Glass\" is straight from the John Doe school of dead-calm supervillainy. The scene where he repeatedly sabotages a book store clerk’s attempts to wheel him out of the shop is a more effective, more affecting demonstration of directionless rage than any of the extravagant acts of terrorism enacted by his screen successors.", "While today’s superhero movies aim for excitement via loud action and bloated narratives, Unbreakable is deadly quiet, only lightly dusted with plot and told with an everyday realism that verges on mundanity. Its sole fight sequence is unpleasant and ungainly, actively un-thrilling, shot from a distance in one unbroken take. Admittedly the film’s slow pacing can seem a bit strained at times, but it’s a directorial style that takes guts to pull off this effectively – and one that’s aged well over a 16-year period in which frenzied spectacle has become the new normal.", "Two years after Unbreakable was released, Raimi’s first Spider-Man film became the highest grossing film of that year, taking close to half a billion dollars worldwide and effectively igniting the superhero movie boom. A decade on, Marvel’s list of past and prospective releases stands at 45, while DC having latterly leapt aboard the gravy train. Between them, these studios are working hard to ensure that the summer blockbuster season remains choc-a-bloc with superhero movies, a trend which shows no sign of letting up. \"These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn,\" Jackson tells Robin Wright’s Audrey Dunn in Unbreakable. \"People are starting to lose hope.\" He didn’t know the half of it.", "Published 21 Aug 2016"], "targetTitle": "Why Unbreakable remains the ultimate superhero movie - Little White L...", "targetDescription": null, "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["https://archive.is/m6cIr/826632c8c919a363a5d565b5ac80d3fb20d5c23b.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/f7e02120b1a9a7be3480b8e3c64c372de911cec4.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/db12219cd0c0fa474288f8d970a53ab365ec3d8e.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/2ca12a003ba2a59eaa73e6535cbb94bf543e6a93.gif", "data:image/png;base64,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", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/1ec83eec7c5c0bc2a0a9302951ea04935a821221.gif", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/758e32443ba20b573effd1955aacd2eff5548d2a.png", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/7681e135e809ac8f9551e469a1f6b3cb272dc54b.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/04e4c94b5c8a4b878a05254ed1ce5d88bdd7bfac.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/81230d834f783fb41b691f536f8924d8ca008874.png", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/5991382db5636f1b796bbb5a6fdbd52608fc639f.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/1ab21373f5e4192ba5007f2d5a5973e736609950.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/1dd54d468af6c34af10c347ac5830188c19d19ec.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,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", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/0f774ba70f36292ec6e9d838a1debb8a7699f73c.gif", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/4aa495994deb51c4acb914601e8fa25ed6b05fe4.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/18057c7ff90d9e0c22110ee1510d6391750c67a6.gif", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex/6gNJowqlzHFZ/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/12d1f3ed0019ab17c3d47008876f3ac889ee8948.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/cfe2c135c2c54c1eaf04619f798e3b10e5728a5d/scr.png", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/d0b67952f24359504ee12553d50a9d99cee43f6c.png", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/1744ae0412c17bb5266cc672ebd91b1548744372.jpg", "https://archive.is/m6cIr/0cf5bafd1bb3b51a77e40b35e789fb460e6a4980.jpg"], "targetUrl": "https://archive.is/m6cIr", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "It's not Marvel or DC", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable"], "spoilerPositions": [[[4, 125], [4, 192]]], "tags": ["passage"]}

After mice ate a peanut-butter-flavored dose of the bug, they navigated mazes twice as fast as those not treated. Turns out, M. vaccae are among the gut bacteria that trigger a rise in serotonin -- which not only calms us but also boosts memory and concentration. (For mice, the \"superbrain\" effect lasted for at least a week after the last exposure.) We inhale and ingest this microbe when we're around dirt and plants; to what extent might it help us navigate life's mazes? Stay tuned.", "\"You're Hungry... Very, Very Hungry\"", "Surprisingly, gut bacteria may also control appetite, nudging you toward the oozy, creamy, crunchy foods they like. Fact is, the little buggers have species-specific appetites (a microbiologist can tell what types of food you eat and predict whether you're slender or not just from the variety of microbes in your stool sample). \"Bad guy\" bacteria may be partly to blame for your junk-food cravings -- by, for instance, sending out sugar-and-fat-jonesing signals via the gut-to-brain vagus nerve. Plus, some microbes may help you extract more calories from food and increase fat storage -- effectively making you put on weight.", "\"You Struggle To Burn Off Your Muffin Top\"", "While the blame for a big belly doesn't lie entirely with its wee inhabitants, the wrong microbes can contribute to it and make it harder to lose. In a study led by Liping Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a 385-pound patient had unusually high counts of a fat-loving bug called Enterobacter in his gut. Zhao transferred the bacterium to his lab mice -- and here's the shocker -- they became fat and diabetic (control animals on the same high-fat diet did not), suggesting that Enterobacter helped cause obesity. As it turns out, the bug triggers chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance and weight gain. The patient lost 113 pounds in 23 weeks on a diet of whole grains and \"prebiotics\" -- nondigestible high-fiber foods (examples include garlic, onions, chicory root, dandelion greens and asparagus) that feed friendly bacteria, like the Bifidobacterium in your yogurt, and starve the bad. (Within weeks, the Enterobacter was completely wiped out.)", "\"You Really Love A Smooth Grenache\"", "Good news here if you think dandelion greens are more compelling when paired with a strong drink. A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that red wine's polyphenols -- those compounds whose heart-healthy benefits you've heard so much about -- also have prebiotic potential. Just one glass (9 ounces) of red wine daily for a month meaningfully boosted drinkers' ratios of good-to-bad gut bacteria (compared with alcohol-free and polyphenol-free gin-drinking controls). A caveat: The benefit doesn't apply to sweet dessert wines, which presumably feed the wrong microbiota.", "\"Sorry, You Have A High-Steak Problem\"", "Now consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. The problem here is that certain red-meat-loving gut bacteria increase your heart attack risk, found a study at the Cleveland Clinic. When microbes digest compounds in meat called carnitine and lecithin, the liver uses the byproduct to make an artery-hardener that may be even more of a culprit in heart disease than cholesterol: trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Note: Only if you have bacteria in your gut that are accustomed to meat -- vegans don't -- could you churn out TMAO.

K. Rowling. How did it work having three writers in the mix?", "John Tiffany Jo Rowling was incredibly generous. I met her first, and I already had a soft spot for her because she used to write in the cafe of the Traverse Theater in Edinburgh when I was the director. It was only after the first book came out that I realized it had been her, nursing one cappuccino for four hours. When we met to talk about the play, she asked, \"What do you think the Harry Potter stories are about?\" I said, \"Learning to deal with death and grief.\" There was something in her eye — I thought, we didn’t say it’s about transformation or magic or flying on brooms, and we’re on the right track.", "Thorne We all met in Edinburgh and as the day developed, we knew we would take the epilogue of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" as a starting point.", "Tiffany All the seeds are there; we start with that scene in the train station. Am I allowed to say that? Anyway, it was clear that she was going to let us take those characters and have our own ideas.", "Callender Of course, Jack came to the table with an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry, so that helped.", "Thorne All right, I’m a nerd. With abandonment issues.", "Did you really sketch out the whole arc of the story in that first meeting?", "Thorne Yes, but then it took about six months to really map the whole thing out. Every time it was like taking a big step forward, one or two small ones back. Jo would say, \"This feels right, this doesn’t.\"", "Tiffany There are parts of the story, which when we first conceived them, I didn’t think she would let us do, but she never hesitated. It is one thing to let us continue the story, another to let us unravel the canon.", "Friedman That’s enough!", "Was the idea of a two-part play there from the beginning?", "Tiffany No, not at all. But we knew we had to deal with going beyond where the books left off, but also go back and look at the stories within them. We wanted to develop the characters that are already known and keep that consistency, but also introduce new ones. It was clearly hard to put an epic tale into two-and-a-half hours. We had a meeting and said, \"Why not two parts?\" And we knew right away how we wanted to end the first part. It’s a cliffhanger.", "Noma Dumezweni It does that wonderful thing that books do when they work; it makes you desperate for more story.", "How is it different telling that story as a play rather than a novel?", "Thorne We can tell the story of the younger and older generation at the same time, which the books didn’t do. The exciting thing has been working out how those worlds fit together. It’s a coming-of-age story as much for the adults as for the children. John and I are more or less the same age as Harry in the play and I just had my first child, so there has been a lot of discussion about growing up, being a parent.", "Tiffany How do you mother or father when you still need parenting yourself?", "Dumezweni Also, I think the difference with a play is that you’re not experiencing the story on your own the way you do with a book. Being in the theater is a communal experience, and this play, with two parts, is a commitment. I’m fascinated to see what my daughter will think after a whole day in the theater. As an actor, it’s something I’ve never experienced before.", "What about dealing with the issue of magic in the theater, where you can’t create the kind of effects that happen in film?", "Tiffany Film has got green screen.

Is it intimidating?", "Dumezweni I think Jamie found it very intimidating. [Everyone laughs.]", "Parker It’s not so different from playing any role that is within a canon. You have the responsibility of being sensitive to the collective investment in the story. But you just have to try to serve the play the best way you can and not worry about that.", "Dumezweni The weight of expectation is huge.

Ultimately it’s a theater piece, I’m a theater actor and doing a job as best I can.", "Has it been difficult to work under conditions of intense secrecy?

The terrorist attacks by Daesh (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Europe, coupled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East have strengthened xenophobia, Islamophobia, and more generally, hatred of foreigners. Daesh itself is a byproduct of the invasion of Iraq that led to the emergence of al-Qaeda in Iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in Libya and Syria. Can things get any worse? Not only can they, we should expect new wars in the Middle East if Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president is elected next November. Even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives’ enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how likely new wars in the Middle East will be.", "Hillary Clinton is a hawk and warmonger. People often point to her vote in 2002 for going to war in Iraq and her enthusiasm for it. After all, it was during her husband’s presidency that toppling the regime of Saddam Hussein became the official policy of the United States. But, her track record of starting and supporting wars, and siding with despots is much deeper than Iraq. She supported the coup in Honduras in 2009 and in Ukraine in 2014; was the leading advocate of the U.S. and NATO intervention in Libya that turned that economically advanced nation into a hub for all types of terrorist groups; laughed shamelessly at the news of Muammar Ghaddafi’s murder; supported extra-judicial assassinations by drones; backed escalation of the war in Afghanistan ordered by President Obama, and has taken an extremely hawkish stance toward Russia. And as Secretary of State she supported massive sale of advanced US weapons to Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Persian Gulf area, all reactionary dictatorships, the same weapons that are being used to attack Yemen.", "The only \"accomplishments\" that she is still lacking are starting a war with Iran and invading Syria. If she is elected president, she may get to add both to her \"impeccable\" track record of war, bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark World War III, if it has not already begun as a result of US policy toward the Middle East.", "Clinton considers Syria and Iran closely linked. In fact, most objective experts and analysts do believe that the war in Syria has a lot to do with Iran, its strategic alliance with Syria, its use of Syrian territory to help the Lebanese Hezbollah, and more generally what the Sunni Arab regimes of the region consider as the \"Shiite crescent\" – the alliance between the Shiites in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon.", "So, before the war began in Syria in 2011, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria as a way of separating the latter from Iran. But, the negotiations failed, as they always do, due to Israel’s intransigence. Thus, to her destroying Syria in order to topple Bashar al-Assad became the pathway for attacking Iran, which she views as necessary for Israel’s sake, as the Clintons have deep connections to Israel and its lobby in the United States", "Her advocacy of direct US intervention in Syria began carefully. One of her top aides, Ann-Marie Slaughter who was director of policy planning at the State Department from 2009-2011, published a piece in the New York Times in February 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in Syria. Clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so-called \"friends of Syria\" group, consisting of several Western nations and the very Arab regimes that despise Iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in Syria, namely, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, as well as Turkey. The group is similar to the Contact Group on Libya, also known as \"friends of Libya,\" which consisted essentially of the same countries and was created to help the opposition forces in Libya in 2011, and we all know what that help led to.", "But, Hillary Clinton has gone even further. In an interview with the CNN she claimed Syria and Iran (as well as Russia) helped creating the Daesh, saying, \"ISIS was primarily the result of the vacuum in Syria caused by Assad first and foremost. Aided and abetted by Iran and Russia.\"", "Despite Clinton’s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with Iran, P5+1 and Iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in July 2015 after Iran made many significant concessions. After the nuclear accord the hope was that rapprochement between Iran and the United States would slowly develop. At the same time, it became crystal clear to practically everyone, from the President and his Vice President Joe Biden, to even the editors of the New York Times that Saudi Arabia and its allies are the main sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East. They are also raping the poor nation of Yemen with US logistic and military support.", "Yet, Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old worn out songs and espousing the same failed policies toward Iran: more sanctions, more military threats, and more diplomatic pressure. This is of course neither new nor surprising. Along with the neocons, the Clintons have always been Iran’s number one enemy in the US political establishment.", "The cliché in the West is that it is Iran that does not want improved relations with the West. That is not true, at least not when Iranian reformists, moderates, and pragmatists have been in power. Three times over the past 20 years the Iranian reformists and moderates have tried to improve the relations between their nation and the United States, and in each case the Clintons have either prevented the rapprochement or, as it is happening now, try to scuttle it.", "In May 1995 former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformists now, made a gesture of reconciliation toward the US by awarding the American oil company Conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf, although a European oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract. But, instead of responding in kind, Bill Clinton imposed total trade embargo on Iran in 1996 as part of his absurd, and ultimately failed \"dual containment\" policy according to which both Iran and Iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box.", "Then, in 1998 former reformist President proposed \"dialogue among civilizations\" as a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nations. Not only had Khatami won the presidential elections in 1997 in a landslide, his allies would sweep the first nationwide elections for city councils in fall of 1998 and for the Majles[Iranian parliament] in February 2000. But, once again, instead of making a major gesture toward Iranian democrats by lifting the economic sanctions, or at least suspending them, Bill Clinton announced that Iran could export pistachio, carpet and caviar to the United States, as if that would impress any Iranian. The Clinton administration claimed that it was seriously seeking formal dialogue with Iran, but Khatami was not interested, unless major sanctions against Iran would first be lifted, which were not.", "After Hillary Clinton was elected a Senator from New York in 2000, she supported every resolution by Congress imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran. All such sanctions are illegal because they have not been approved by the United Nations Security Council. As Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of Western nations that imposed \"the toughest sanctions\" in history on Iran. The sanctions hurt the lives of tens of millions of ordinary Iranians. Now that she is running for President again, Clinton’s campaign brags about her role in putting in place the sanctions, as she does in her memoir as Secretary of State, Hard Choices.", "In an interview with ABC in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton was running for President, she was asked what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons, to which she responded, \"I want the Iranians to know that if I’m the president, we will attack Iran. In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel we would be able to totally obliterate them\" (emphasis mine). Iran did not and does not have nuclear weapons and Clinton knew it, but she did not even declare that if Iran attacked Israel, which is highly unlikely if not impossible (unless Israel attacks first), she would defend Israel. Her threat to obliterate Iran, a very large country, can be accomplished by only one means: Attacking Iran with nuclear weapons.", "Even though Clinton’s most important \"accomplishment\" as Secretary of State, namely, attacking Libya under the guise of \"humanitarian intervention,\" which was nothing but naked military aggression, has been a total catastrophe, in interviews with the BBC and Voice of America in October 2011 she claimed that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship. While the leaders of Iran’s Green Movement, a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after Iran’s fraudulent presidential elections of June 2009, rejected any US help, Clinton said in the interviews that if they had asked for help, the US was prepared to help them the way it helped Libyan rebels. In other words, the US would have tried regime change in Iran.", "Although Hillary Clinton claims that she supports the nuclear accord with Iran, she never misses a chance to demonize and belittles Iran. In a speech at the Brookings Institution last September, Clinton declared, \"I don’t see Iran as our partner in implementing this agreement. I believe Iran is the subject of the agreement\" (emphasis mine), as if Iran is a banana republic that is subject to US will. In an article in TheJewish Journal she threatened Iran again,", "\"We have to send Iran an unequivocal message. There can be no doubt in Tehran that if Iran’s leaders violate their commitments not to seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons, the United States will stop them. They will test our resolve with actions like their provocative ballistic missile test, for which we should impose new sanctions designations. They need to understand that America will act decisively if Iran violates the nuclear agreement, including taking military action if necessary.\" (emphasis added).", "Clinton’s rhetoric regarding Iran, even after the nuclear accord, only creates trouble for the administration of President Hassan Rouhani in the midst of his fierce power struggle with Tehran’s hardliners. By taking a hardline toward the nuclear agreement and improved relations with Iran, Hillary Clinton is a strong ally of Iranian hardliners who also do not want any rapprochement with the United States.", "In addition to constantly demonizing Iran, Hillary Clinton is always looking for ways of imposing new economic sanctions on Iran to carry favor with the pro-Israel lobby and its rich donors. For example, it is well known that Iranian hardliners were, and still are opposed to the nuclear agreement with P5+1, just as the neocons and the extreme right in the United States opposed it and still do. So, the Iranian hardliners have tried to demonstrate their unhappiness with the nuclear accord, and one way of doing so, in addition to creating other problems for the Rouhani administration, has been testing ballistic missiles. The missiles are purely defensive weapons meant to deter Israel and the tests, unlike what the opposition to the nuclear accord in the United States claims, do not violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231 that was issued after the nuclear accord to endorse it. Despite these glaring facts, after the missile tests, Mrs. Clinton quickly called for new sanctions against Iran.", "During the primary season the Clinton campaign slammed Senator Sanders’ suggestion that the US and Iran should have closer relations. Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton’s senior policy adviser, said on January 21, \"This proposal [by Sanders] to more aggressively normalize relations and to move to warm relations with Iran not only breaks with President Obama’s policy, it breaks with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that’s been working for the United States.\" This is not surprising. Hardliners everywhere are allies of each other and feed one another, and Clinton and Tehran’s hardliners are no exception.", "Not only does Hillary Clinton not want improved relations with Iran, she has been itching to find an excuse start a war with that nation and, thus, she constantly demonizes Iran. But, in addition to demonizing Iran, she also lies about that nation brazenly. For example, similar to Benjamin Netanyahu she always refers collectively to Iran, Daesh and the Palestinian group Hamas, as if they are allies. Iran has been fighting Daesh in both Syria and Iraq. Iran cut off its financial aid to Hamas after that organization refused to back Bashar al-Assad in Syria. There is absolutely no relation between Hamas and Daesh. In fact, many senior Israeli officers have made it clear that they prefer Hamas to run Gaza, because the alternative would be either Daesh or one of the terrorist groups allied with it,", "Why is Mrs. Clinton so anti-Iran? I can think of at least two reasons. One is that Hillary Clinton has never given up her imperial ambitions to reshape the Middle East, because she believes in American \"exceptionalism\" and always speaks about \"American global leadership,\" which only means world dominance. She sees Iran as an impediment to her ambitions for the Middle East. Why does she want to reshape the Middle East and possibly change the borders? This brings us to the second reason for her being anti-Iran. Clinton is an Israel \"firster.\" Anything that she wants for the Middle East is intended for making the region as \"safe\" for Israel as possible. Clinton is not bothered by the fact that Israel is run by the far right with expansionist ambitions. To see this, all one has to do is listening to her speech at the annual meeting of AIPAC in March.", "When asked during her first Democratic presidential debate last October \"which enemy are you most proud of,\" Hillary Clinton included \"the Iranians\" among them. This was truly disturbing. Was she talking about 80 million Iranians? If she meant the Iranian government, why did she not say so? Why did she not make it clear that she meant, for example, Tehran’s hardliners? Apparently, Hillary Clinton considers all Iranians as the enemy, which is truly disturbing.", "Those who argue that we should vote for Clinton as the lesser of two evils in the upcoming presidential elections are truly misguided. Yes, for decades if not longer elections in the United State have been reduced to choosing between bad and worse. But, not this time. Hillary Clinton is simply as terrible as Donald Trump, if not worse. Expect new catastrophic wars in the Middle East, especially one with Iran, if she is elected.", "This article (Expect Hillary to Do This Almost Immediately If She Wins in November) by Muhammad Sahimi, originally appeared on AntiWar.com and was used with permission.

They quit smoking using hypnotherapy. Celebrities have discovered the effective results of hypnotherapy and have used it to conquer their own smoking habits.", "Researchers at the University of Iowa combined more than 600 studies of smoking cessation programs involving 72,000 people from North America and Europe1. Hypnosis was found to be over 3 times more effective than nicotine replacement therapy and 15 times more effective than quitting cold turkey.", "A comparison study of smoking cessation treatments was conducted by North Shore Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital2. 26 weeks after discharge, 50% of patients who received hypnotherapy exclusively were non-smokers compared to the 25% of patients who didn't and only 16% of patients who used nicotine replacement therapy alone.", "Types of Addiction", "Smoking addiction is a combination of two types of addiction. There's the physical addiction, then there is the mental, or psychological addiction. Although nicotine addiction is considered one of the strongest addictions, even more addictive than cocaine, the good news is that the physical side of things doesn't last very long. In fact, some believe that you will lose the physical cravings for nicotine in as little as 3 days.", "The real struggle for smokers is overcoming the mental addiction. The smoker has essentially trained their subconscious mind to make smoking an automatic behavior. These are the habits and rituals that a smoker has developed over the years such as smoking when they wake up, just before they go to sleep, after they eat, when they drive, when they drink coffee or alcohol, and so on.", "How Hypnotherapy Helps You Quit", "So what will hypnotherapy do? Rather than just treating the physical urges that are part of your smoking habit, hypnotherapy targets the subconscious drive behind the addiction, and breaks the positive associations with cigarettes that the mind has formed. This is replaced by an empowering, smoke-free perspective the hypnotist offers through verbal suggestions that deem smoking as something undesirable  or unnecessary  to do. Gradually, these suggestions take hold and diminish the smoker's impulse to smoke. Furthermore, hypnotherapy is considered to be a far more safe and natural method to quit smoking with and is non-habit forming. This cannot be said about most of the stop smoking aids we currently have on the market.", "But going to a hypnotist can be expensive. As much as $200 per one hour session, and requiring as many as 5 sessions for the entire treatment. If you're a celebrity like the ones mentioned earlier, then this isn't a problem. But can the average smoker afford to go to a hypnotherapist? Well, that question is left to the individual, but consider that a pack a day smoker will spend in excess of $2000 a year on cigarettes, not even including the increased cost of life and health insurance, and doesn't include the drastic cut in your ability to earn."], "targetTitle": "What is the easiest way to quit smoking?", "targetDescription": null, "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ads.jpg", "http://bttrack.com/Pixel/Retarget/324", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/call-to-action2.png", "http://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=5441966&Ver=2", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/small-1.jpg", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ybtlogo.png", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ps10_2.jpg", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/ps10_1.jpg", "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/images/smoke1019062015.jpg"], "targetUrl": "http://www.yourbettertomorrow.com/presale/easiest-way-to-stop-smoking-10.php?eid=Mjg=&amp;var1=yav&amp;var2=[var2]&amp;var3=[var3]&amp;eid=11&amp;vid=55920240", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "Be a rich celebrity.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["Hypnosis"], "spoilerPositions": [[[3, 155], [3, 163]]], "tags": ["phrase"]}

Until then you’ll have to hold onto your wrist rockets, but The Duffer Brothers did give Entertainment Weekly teasers about the show to get everyone all jacked up for the new season.", "Watch the teaser above, and here’s what we know so far.", "1. The action’s going to pick back up in Fall of 1984. So plan accordingly by getting all your friends the correct walkie talkies to discuss the finer points of Steve’s hair.", "It will be a continuation of the first season’s story. \"I think we talked like a larger time jump where the kids are older now and it’s a different decade,\"Ross Duffer revealed to 2.\"I think we talked like a larger time jump where the kids are older now and it’s a different decade,\"Ross Duffer revealed to EW . \"That’s something we batted around from the very beginning. But for us, there’s still more story here, there’s still things that are unresolved.\" These are the people coming right back at you, so you can continue to live life: Joyce, woman of light bulb chats (Winona Ryder); Mike (Finn Wolfhard), whose love for Eleven was huge; and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), the kid who says everything you can’t, but the writer-directors were cryptic about Eleven . \"We don’t know about Eleven,\" Ross Duffer says. \"We leave that up in the air.\" Disappointingly, no mention of whether the show’s heartthrob Dr. Brenner lived to melt our hearts another day.", "3. Expect four brand new characters. \"There’s going to be a lot of new and interesting dynamics that we didn’t see in season 1,\" Matt Duffer says. In the teaser, we see the words \"The Lost Brother.\" So fingers crossed Barb’s mom can lose one more kid the show can drop like a bad habit, in case that family didn’t endure enough misery.", "There’s one more major influence that will inspire this season. Bringing the show’s 4.Bringing the show’s tally of cool guys the Duffer Brothers admire up to 6 million, the new season will have a heavy James Cameron influence. Matt Duffer explained why. \"I know movie sequels get a lot of s—, but the ones we look up to aspire to pivot and do something different,\" he says. \"There’s Temple of Doom, Aliens, Terminator 2. I guess a lot of this is James Cameron. But he’s brilliant. And I think one of the reasons his sequels are as successful as they are is he makes them feel very different without losing what we loved about the original. So I think we kinda looked to him and what he does and tried to capture a little bit of the magic of his work.\" We’ll never let go, Barb. We’ll never let go", "Courtesy of Netflix Stranger Things", "5. Good old monster-infested Hawkins won’t be the only location. Season two will open on another town, the creators reveal. (It’s conceivable that the Byers’ and co. wanted to have a new beginning in a town without terrifying government operatives at every turn, but given that adorable little William coughs up a slug at the end, they’re not escaping the past anytime soon.)", "6. Everyone will still have access to the Upside Down. Great news, in case they want to go hang with the throat snakes for a fun long weekend for the whole family. There will be more discussion of the otherworld and some loose ends will be tied and the creators even posed some questions because a good teacher never keeps a curiosity door locked. They assure us the show will answer some long-marinating questions. \"We obviously have this gate to another dimension, which is still very much open in the town of Hawkins. And a lot of questions there in terms of, if the Monster is dead, was it a singular monster? What else could be out there? We really don’t go in there much until they go in to find Will at the end. So we’ve opened up this doorway, and to us it’s exciting to talk about, like, what else is behind there? There’s a lot more mystery there to be solved.\"", "7. It will be nine episodes instead of eight. This way, fans can spend nine hours without moving in front of the screen, because life is fair. \"We’re letting the story dictate it,\" says Matt. \"I think if it gets any longer, it gets unwieldy for us. We want to make sure it’s manageable and we want to be able to tell a movie-like story where it’s never treading water. We want it to have the same feel and pacing as season 1. I think if we extend it too much, it will have a very different feel.\""], "targetTitle": "7 Things We Know About the New Season of Stranger Things", "targetDescription": "The Duffer Brothers reveal

He’s handsome but pimply and given to throwing up after eating; he daydreams of the beautiful woman he’ll one day fall in love with, but treats the real women he meets like inconveniently sentient Kleenex.", "Oh, and then there are his hands. \"As good-looking as I was, I was scared nobody would ever marry me,\" he admits. \"I had small hands. They were like a girl’s hands, but with hair. Nobody marries men with hands like that.\" When he goes to a meet-up he’s planned with a strange woman, he shoves his hand down her throat, enjoying that he can see how his intrusive hand bulges her neck. He recalls taking a prostitute to a motel room: \"I sat down next to her and splayed my hands out on the bed. ‘What do you think about these?’ I asked. Nobody ever gave me the answer I wanted. Nobody ever said, ‘Oh, so beautiful!’\"", "Moshfegh’s fiction is nothing if not distinctive. As in her debut novel, Eileen, the narrators of the 14 stories in Homesick for Another World are gloomy, narcissistic and self-pitying. Their lives are claustrophobic and squalid. They’re constantly squeezing their acne, having sex with people they despise, eating candy and drinking until they’re sick, developing meth addictions just for kicks, and always feeling slightly superior to their own surroundings despite their listless lives. They crave adoration, but look on anyone who gives it to them with contempt.", "In one story, a man obsesses over a woman who works at a video game arcade he frequents. He finally manages to secretly court her via text, but quickly loses his interest in her once she seems attainable: \"He took out his phone and reread all her texts again. ‘I am very lonely and troubled. Who are you?’ She sounded desperate, he thought. He had made a grievous mistake, he thought.\"", "In a story called \"The Beach Boy,\" a man’s wife dies suddenly after their 29th anniversary celebration on a tropical island. Initially devastated and adrift, he then catches sight of an unfamiliar face in the photos he developed from the trip. Though it’s out of focus and context-free, he’s convinced that it was a picture taken by his late wife ― of a male prostitute from the island. Suddenly, he’s revolted by her, the woman he thought was a lady, but who he’s now certain was unfaithful. \"Marcia was gone for good now,\" Moshfegh writes after her ashes were disposed of, \"and he felt like celebrating.\"", "The women in Homesick for Another World are equally self-involved and dismissive of their romantic partners. In one story, a woman lives with her boyfriend, who manages a dingy apartment complex while pursuing his dream of acting. She quietly loathes him, the way he clenches his muscles constantly to stay in shape, his devotion to a crystal skull he keeps by his bed, the yellow women’s blazer he bought secondhand and considers the height of manly fashion. He develops a meth addiction. She never really tries to leave. In another story, a high school English teacher spends her summers in a dying small town, subsisting on subs and drugs. She has a brief fling with a local: \"I still remember the humility it took for me to agree to take him home.\" She hires a heavily pregnant young woman to clean her home, then calmly ignores it when her housekeeper begins to hemorrhage on the job.", "The unpleasant, even grotesque behaviors of her characters seem amplified thanks to Moshfegh’s cool, matter-of-fact prose. In either first-person or close third-person narration, the blunt, unemotional words with which her characters relate their petty cruelties, addictions, and even bodily functions never ceases to be slightly jarring. In much fiction, writers draw us in by painting the relatable, lovable vulnerabilities within even their most nominally unsympathetic characters, complicating our impulse to divide the world into \"good\" and \"bad.\" Moshfegh’s stories do the reverse, confronting readers with the squicky, selfish, and sociopathic inner selves of even outwardly decent people. ", "Reading Homesick for Another World offers a similar experience to watching a dark comedy, like the British sitcom \"Peep Show.\" There’s something refreshing and funny about her unvarnished portrayal of human squalor, but also something unsettling and difficult to swallow. It’s not a book to reassure readers of the essential goodness of the human race; it’s a queasy jolt to our optimistic selves, a reminder of the lowest, most id-driven proclivities of humanity. This may sound unappealing, yet Moshfegh’s talent is a sheer delight ― and the heedless misbehavior of her characters is a reminder, needed now more than ever, that we’re not such an elevated species as we’d like to think, and that following our base impulses can lead us nowhere fast. ", "The Bottom Line:", "Moshfegh’s stories of selfish people doing foul things capture the dark side of human nature, which is easy but self-deluding to ignore.", "What other reviewers think:", "The New York Times: \"If there’s a thematic thread weaving through this collection, it’s the complicated relationship between entrapment in the physical body — her characters are often probing, picking and searching with their fingertips, as if seeking beauty and potential grace — and entrapment in social landscapes.\"", "NPR: \"There’s not a story in Homesick for Another World that’s anything less than original and perfectly constructed. Moshfegh’s talent is unique, and her characters — unfiltered, cold, frequently pathetic — are all the more memorable for their faults and obliviousness.\"", "Who wrote it?", "Ottessa Moshfegh has previously published a novel, Eileen, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and was given the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award. After her book, a noir novel about a miserable and self-loathing young woman who works in a detention center, was nominated for the Man Booker Prize, she notoriously confessed to The Guardian that she’d written the book as a joke to get attention. She has published her short fiction in The Paris Review and The New Yorker, among other outlets.", "Who will read it?", "Fans of shocking, provocative fiction starring intensely disagreeable characters ― and readers who don’t mind being grossed out.", "Opening lines:", "\"My classroom was on the first floor, next to the nuns’ lounge. I used their bathroom to puke in the mornings. One nun always dusted the toilet seat with talcum powder. Another nun plugged the sink and filled it with water. I never understood the nuns. One was old and one was young. The young one talked to me sometimes, asked me what I would do for the long weekend, if I’d see my folks over Christmas, and so forth. The old one looked the other way and twisted her robes in her fists when she saw me coming.\"", "Notable passage:", "\"Her pretty, gleaming calves appeared between the rungs of the banister as she came down the steps. She’d folded the cuffs of her leggings up above her knees, which were red from kneeling on the floor. When her thighs appeared, I saw a black stain of blood at her crotch. She seemed not to know that she was bleeding. There was no way she could have seen the blood past the mountain of her belly, I suppose.

David Jolly introduced his quixotic plan to ban members of Congress from soliciting campaign contributions, the Florida Republican had only six co-sponsors.", "Then, three weeks ago, \"60 Minutes\" did a sympathetic piece on Jolly’s idea, giving national attention to the scandal of lawmakers spending 30 or more hours a week dialing for dollars.", "And now? The number of co-sponsors on Jolly’s bill has jumped from six all the way up to — um, eight. No senator has come forward with similar legislation.", "Jolly, appearing Monday morning at the National Press Club with his lead Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. Rick Nolan (Minn.), was not surprised. \"We’ve got six more co-sponsors than I thought we might have,\" he said. It’s \"a heartbreaking reflection on what the priorities of the Congress are. . . . A member’s political survival depends on raising money — that’s the reality.\"", "Jolly speaks the truth. Lawmakers know what needs to be done to clean up the corrupt system — but nothing happens.", "Democrats talk about overturning the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums on politics. But that ultimate fix isn’t happening soon. In the House, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) has recruited 160 co-sponsors for his system of public financing of elections — another good idea — but so far he has only one Republican, gadfly Walter Jones (N.C.). Republicans remain reflexively opposed to reform, including the idea of disclosure, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) once championed.", "This is why Jolly’s idea deserves a look. He calls it congressional reform, not campaign-finance reform. The goal: to get lawmakers to spend more time lawmaking. \"We’re here three days a week, and half your time is spent raising money,\" he said. \"In the face of growing crises around the globe, you’ve got a part-time Congress.\" This, he said, \"is a first-rate scandal.\"", "I’ve argued for other ways to get lawmakers to spend more time working — returning to the five-day week, cutting travel allowances, ending the corrosive practice of members targeting each other for defeat through party committees. Jolly, now a Senate candidate in Florida, offers another tack.", "The Republican Party is predictably opposed. The National Republican Congressional Committee, in a letter to CBS after the \"60 Minutes\" segment, accused Jolly of peddling \"fiction\" when he said party officials told him he had to raise $18,000 a day.", "Unfortunately, liberals have piled on. Campaign-finance reformer Fred Wertheimer told me the idea \"is not going to solve the problem,\" because those working for the members could still solicit funds. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, wrote Unfortunately, liberals have piled on. Campaign-finance reformer Fred Wertheimer told me the idea \"is not going to solve the problem,\" because those working for the members could still solicit funds. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, wrote a piece in the Orlando Sentinel calling Jolly’s bill a \"cynical example of fraudulent reform\" because \"all that would change is that congressmen wouldn’t have to do the dirty work.\"", "But while Jolly can be accused of election-year gimmickry, he voluntarily refused to solicit contributions for his Senate run. And though the bill wouldn’t by itself solve the campaign-finance mess, it could help to improve the woeful political culture in other ways.", "Jolly’s Democratic sidekick, Nolan, said that when he first served in Congress in the 1970s, lawmakers worked full weeks, giving them time to develop respect for one another and to find common ground.", "\"If you’ve already consumed 40, 50 hours of the week in travel and fundraising, there’s not a lot of time left over for governing, and we’re seeing the results of that,\" he said. \"We’re looking at the last couple of sessions of the Congress of the United States as being the most unproductive in the history of the country. Why? Well, if everybody’s busy campaigning and raising money, there’s no time for governing.\"", "The little support Jolly has gained for the idea comes largely from Florida, home to three of his eight co-sponsors, including Democrat Alan Grayson, also a Senate candidate. A Democratic congressional candidate in Florida, businessman Randy Perkins, went one step further, announcing he would stop \"soliciting or accepting\" financial contributions.", "But Jolly, a former lobbyist and longtime staffer to the late congressman C.W. Bill Young, continues to agitate. He said he’s not paying his $400,000 in dues to the NRCC, and he said \"I don’t buy the notion\" that he needs more sponsors before House leadership grants a hearing on his bill.", "Jolly is a potential ally of Democrats on campaign-finance reform, saying that Citizens United \"could be revisited\" and that \"we can do better.\" Until then, surely more lawmakers on both sides can see the virtue of his cause. \"You think you get elected to represent 700,000 people,\" he said. \"But you actually got elected to be one more marble on our side of the aisle to keep the majority, and to do that you’ve got to go raise $2 million — and that makes members angry.\"", "Or at least it should."], "targetTitle": "Lawmakers could do this to fight corruption.

So choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue.", "Other ways of measuring \"worth\":", "When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth’s well-being, too.", "\"When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,\" she told HuffPost. \"Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me.\"", "According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health.", "But organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit.", "Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation.", "Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large.", "\"Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,\" he said. \"It’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly.\"", "According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers.", "\"Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,\" the nonprofit writes.", "Many organic farms are small operations, though \"big organic\" farms do exist as well.

Prioritize your purchases.", "\"It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,\" advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University’s Pancreas Center, in a blog post.", "She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible.", "\"Some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,\" she said.", "Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. \"The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,\" said Lu.", "For produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable.", "\"Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,\" said Gerszberg.", "The Environmental Working Group's \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"Clean Fifteen\" lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The \"clean\" list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower.", "2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce.", "Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative.", "\"The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor,\" writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont. \"Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities.\"", "Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient. It also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation.", "It's estimated that the average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture. In contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less.", "3. Buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too.", "Many mainstream supermarkets, including Safeway, Target, Wal-Mart and H-E-B, carry organic store-brand options, while Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's sell organic foodstuffs in bulk. Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products.", "4. Keep an eye out for sales and coupons. Sites like All Natural Savings and Organic Deals can help customers surface organic food deals.", "5. Grow your own food. It might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isn't as difficult as it sounds. It just requires a bit of effort and patience.

Nobody said that,\" he said. \"People just got here early,\" he explained, pointing out that the campaign was offering free muffins, berries, and juice.", "Not everyone—especially the hundreds who'd received the campaign's invitation for an 8:30 pancake breakfast—was satisfied. \"It's the Marco Rubio pancake breakfast—so far we've had no pancakes and no Marco Rubio,\" joked Bob Durant, a Rhode Island lawyer who was political touring with his family and friends. \"You wonder is it really because you have so many people,\" that things are delayed, Bob asked, or is it because, after the debate, \"He has to re-write his entire speech, since Chris Christie ripped it up?\"", "His wife, Meg, was watching it all with more of an insider's eye. The Michigan state director for the Bush/Quayle 1992 campaign, Meg Durant looks for the little things to tell her how a campaign is doing. After Saturday's Republican debate, she grabbed a couple of Christie and Bush signs for her kids.

He's still undecided; his wife was for Hillary Clinton until she went to a Clinton rally last week.

He's still going to abolish the federal Department of Education, but he's decided to offer Tom Brady \"a cabinet position. Belichick, too.\" And then, because at best he can only really modify and not stop himself, \"Well, I'm going to say it again.... Barack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. ... Not fix its problems; he wants to make it a different kind of country.\"", "Things perked up a little bit when Rubio agreed to answer a few questions, calling on innocuous-looking white haired fellow in a bright flannel shirt. Identifying himself as Capt. Dan, a 65-year-old retired charter boat operator and a Rubio constituent from Florida, he wondered what a President Rubio would do about the climate change flooding that's putting his house in Miami Beach underwater. \"I'm going to get my money out of it and move to higher ground,\" Capt. Dan explained, who added that he doesn't expect to live forever. Isn't there something Rubio can do about climate change \"for the young people?\"", "Rubio has a script for this question. Climate change legislation hurts the economy. It hurts the economy and has no real impact on the environment. The better approach is to support innovators of American energy. \"I say, 'OK, if we pass this bill how many feet of sea rise will it prevent?'\" he explained, reasonably, as he has on this and many other occasions. \"'Well, it won't prevent any sea rise.' OK, well how many degrees of temperature will it avoid going up?' Well, it won't do that either.\"", "But afterwards, Capt.

That's because Scarlett Johansson -- who co-stars with Joaquin Phoenix in the film, but doesn't appear onscreen -- gives such a remarkable performance that she could wind up with an historic Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.", "Jonze's film, a near-future tale about a man (Phoenix) who falls in love with his computer operating system (voiced by Johansson), received high praise from many critics following its debut, with most singling out Johansson's voice work as exceptional.", "\"It's Johansson who pulls off the trickiest feat: She creates a complex, full-bodied character without any body at all. Detached from her lethally curvaceous figure, the actress' breathy contralto is no less seductive, but it also alights with tenderness and wonder as Samantha, both here on Earth and up there in the Cloud, voraciously devours literature, philosophy and human experience,\" wrote Variety critic Scott Foundas.", "\"Johansson's work in the film is lovely, and the best thing about the way she plays the part is that there's nothing calculated or 'sexy' about the way she approaches it. Removed from the undeniable sweater-girl appeal she packs when she's onscreen, forced to rely only on her voice, Johansson comes across as a warm, curious, vibrant personality. It's incredibly appealing,\" echoed HitFix critic Drew McWeeny. (HuffPost Entertainment was in the tank for Johansson as well.)", "With regard to Johansson's Oscar bona fides, the issue becomes slightly tricky. As Deadline.com's Pete Hammond pointed out, non-traditional \"flesh-and-blood\" acting roles -- like Andy Serkis, who did revolutionary motion-capture work as Gollum in the \"Lord of the Rings\" films -- are normally ignored by Academy Awards voters.

This had to be the year.", "It was.", "On Wednesday night the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians, 8-7, in a Game 7 for the ages. With that victory — yes, the following words are really true — the Chicago Cubs won the World Series.", "But it just couldn’t come easy, couldn’t be won without extra drama. The Cubs carried a 6-3 lead into the eighth inning, six outs away from a cathartic victory. But a double and a two-run home run by the Indians wiped out that lead and tied the game, and the deadlock held through the ninth inning.", "Then the rain came. Of course. The top of the 10th inning was delayed for about 15 minutes by a deluge. But once it let up, the Cubs poured it on in the 10th inning, scoring 2 runs to provide the cushion they needed. World Series M.V.P. Ben Zobrist hit a go-ahead double, and Miguel Montero followed up with an R.B.I. single to give the Cubs the insurance run they needed.", "It is their third title in the World Series, a competition that was introduced in 1903, but this may be the sweetest and hardest-earned championship in the history of American sports. Making it even more sweet was that the Cubs trailed in the series by three games to one.", "Upon the final out the players jumped and celebrated on the diamond while thousands of visiting Cubs fans screamed joyfully in the stands. Back in Chicago, where fans in the North Side of Chicago have waited generations for this day, revelers poured into the streets for party that will probably last days.", "In Cleveland, a city with its own hard-luck sports history, the wait continues. The Indians have not won the World Series since 1948, and they now own the longest drought in baseball without a title. At least the Cleveland Cavaliers, many of whom were in attendance Wednesday at Progressive Field, broke Cleveland’s 52-year span without a major professional sports title by winning the N.B.A. championship in June.", "For the Cubs, whose long history is riddled with the mythology of billy goat curses, black cats and a fan who was vilified for interfering with a foul ball, theirs is now a history of winning, and their identity changes forever.", "Theo Epstein knows all about that. He is the Cubs’ top baseball decision-maker, the man who put together a team and an ethos capable of dashing history’s long reach.", "Prior to joining the Cubs, Epstein was the general manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2004, when that once-accursed franchise won its first World Series in 86 years. Red Sox and Cubs fans were the longest suffering at the time, and Epstein has given closure to both.", "Here’s an inning-by-inning breakdown of how the Cubs won Game 7:", "Top of 1st: Fowler Crushes One", "Corey Kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single World Series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when Dexter Fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the Cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the Indians fans at Cleveland’s Progressive Field. It was the first leadoff home run ever in Game 7 of a World Series.", "After Fowler’s blast, Kyle Schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. The Indians had the shift on, and Francisco Lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but Schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single.", "Kris Bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and Anthony Rizzo followed him by flying out to center. Schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the Indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with Ben Zobrist at the plate, but Kluber was able to get Zobrist to pop out to end the inning.", "Kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for.", "David Waldstein: When Fowler hit that home run, I almost thought for a moment that Rajai Davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted. But it was Cubs fans celebrating the home run. I have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game. Yes, you will see a lot of Yankees fans in Tampa in May, but this is Game 7 of the World Series. If it is not 50-50 between Cubs and Indians fans, then it is 40-60. In the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent Cubs fans.", "Bottom of 1st: Indians Can’t Match Cubs’ Start", "The Indians were not able to match the Cubs’ strong start to the game.", "Leadoff man Carlos Santana crushed a liner to right on Kyle Hendricks’s first pitch, but it was right at Jason Heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out. Jason Kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three. Francisco Lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but Javier Baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed Lindor to reach safely. Hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from Mike Napoli to end the inning.", "Victor Mather: Hendricks last pitched in Game 3, when he threw 4 1/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks. But crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs.", "David Waldstein: Terry Francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after Game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs. He woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the TV remote and it was stuck in his ribcage. He also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses. \"My bedroom looked like a national disaster last night,\" he said. Too much info?", "Top of 2nd: Kluber Settles In", "Kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches. Addison Russell was the offensive star of Game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but Corey Kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop. Willson Contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that Lonnie Chisenhall tracked down with little effort. Jason Heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop.", "David Waldstein: Kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls. Kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at Progressive Field with a 1.87 earned run average, including postseason games. But this is the only time he has started three times in nine days. Now it’s up the the Indians hitters to get him back even.", "Bottom of 2nd: Hendricks Helps Himself", "The Indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it.", "Jose Ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of Kyle Hendricks before rolling toward shortstop. With the ball coming at him fairly slowly, Addison Russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as Ramirez reached first. The play was ruled a single rather than an error, as Russell likely did not have a play. Ramirez, however, underestimated Hendricks’ ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first.", "Lonnie Chisenhall singled, but Rajai Davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering Davis’s speed.", "David Waldstein: Great play by the icy-veined Kyle Hendricks to pick off Jose Ramirez off first. But everyone knows Hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught. That really messed up the inning because Chisenhall’s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out.", "The Indians were very sloppy in Game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the Cubs’ batters getting warmed up in this weather.", "Top of 3rd: Schwarber Runs Cubs Out of Inning", "Javier Baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning. Dexter Fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from Corey Kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right. With two outs, Kyle Schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield. But Schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by Lonnie Chisenhall to end the inning.", "Victor Mather: Maybe you aren’t a baseball fan. Well, Akron and Toledo are involved in some exciting college football MACtion on ESPN2. As you might expect, with an Indians World Series on the line, the crowd is sparse in Akron.", "David Waldstein: Lonnie Chisenhall has had an adventurous World Series, but he has a great arm and Schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee. The shenanigans in the outfield in Game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, Tyler Naquin, and that is why he is on the bench.", "Bottom of 3rd: Indians Get Aggressive", "The Indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single. It looked like it could get far worse for the Cubs, but Kyle Hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners.", "Coco Crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double. Hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the Indians had Roberto Perez bunt Crisp over to third. Carlos Santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing Crisp home and tying the game.", "With one run in, Jason Kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop. Addison Russell flipped to Javier Baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play.", "The defensive miscue set Cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out. But Francisco Lindor flied out to left and Mike Napoli lined out to third to end the threat.", "Victor Mather: It’s been a tough Series for Napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs. It was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on Santana at second was overturned. Baez never had it.", "David Waldstein: The Indians are squaring up on Hendricks, so Cubs Manager Joe Maddon instructed Jon Lester to start warming up.", "It was so important for the Indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run. Some may have wanted the Indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on Hendricks, but Francona elected to draw even. Roberto Perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with Rizzo only about 20 feet away from him. The Cubs, particularly Baez, are looking shaky.", "Top of 4th: Cubs Back on Top", "A shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by Kris Bryant put the Cubs back in the lead. Willson Contreras tacked on an R.B.I. double and with a 3-1 lead, Chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game.", "Bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against Corey Kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left. Anthony Rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up Ben Zobrist with two runners on and no outs. He hit a grounder to first that Mike Napoli fielded and threw to Francisco Lindor who was covering second. Rizzo slid in under Lindor’s feet, but was ruled out even though Lindor’s foot may not have been on the bag.", "That brought up Addison Russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center. Bryant, knowing that Rajai Davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as Davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from Roberto Perez.", "Kluber looked like he had Contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over Davis’s head. Zobrist scored and Contreras got into second base easily. Kluber ended the bleeding by retiring Jason Heyward on a pop-out to shortstop.", "David Waldstein: Now the Indians are making the miscues. The Cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero. The Believelanders are feeling like Bereavelanders.", "Victor Mather: Wilson Contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the Cubs’ worst Series performer. But he comes through to give the Cubs the 3-1 lead. His rookie season was a key part of the Cubs’ fine year; now he adds a big World Series R.B.I.", "Bottom of 4th: Hendricks Works Well With a Lead", "Kyle Hendricks undoubtedly has an incredibly short leash from Joe Maddon, but he started things off well in the half-inning by retiring Jose Ramirez on a soft grounder to first base. He retired Lonnie Chisenhall on a soft fly to left for the second out, and got Rajai Davis to fly to right to end the inning. Hendricks has thrown just 50 pitches, but it would be surprising if he stayed in the game beyond the fifth inning.", "David Waldstein: That was a great inning by Hendricks. One of the most important things in pitching is the shutdown inning after your team scores. Hendricks had his cleanest frame of the game and that was vital in terms of solidifying the lead and demoralizing the Indians. The tension and the excitement that was felt in this stadium just an inning ago has changed perceptibly. Now it feels just a tiny bit more like a sense of inevitability. The Cubs seem to be rolling ever since Game 5. Still a ways to go, though. The meat of the Indians’ order comes up at least two more times.", "Top of 5th: Baez Ends Kluber’s Night", "The Cubs extended their lead to four the hard way, by getting one apiece off of Corey Kluber and Andrew Miller.", "Javier Baez took a hard cut at Kluber’s first pitch of the inning and crushed a home run, ending the ace’s night. Terry Francona immediately headed to the mound to replace him with Miller and start what could be a long night for the Indians’ bullpen.", "Dexter Fowler was the first batter to face Miller and was not intimidated by the reliever, stroking a 1-2 slider into left for a single. But Kyle Schwarber gave Miller some help by grounding into a 6-4-3 double-play.", "Kris Bryant came up with two outs and worked a full-count off of Miller. He somehow ended up drawing a walk on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, after seeing Miller’s \"unhittable\" slider on six consecutive pitches, and then was running on the pitch when Anthony Rizzo sliced a single to right. Bryant, running hard the entire way, was able to score and Rizzo reached second after the throw.", "It looked like Chicago could do even more damage when Ben Zobrist hit a ball to deep center field, but Rajai Davis caught it on the warning track to end the inning. Miller, who the Indians would like to soak up at least a few innings, has already thrown 20 pitches.", "David Waldstein: The Cubs are really swinging well now in the warm weather, much like they did in the regular season when they scored 808 runs, the most by a National League team at sea level (Red Sox had 878 runs, the Rockies 845). Perhaps it was only a matter of time, perhaps it was fatigue among the Indians’ pitchers, perhaps it was the addition of Schwarber lengthening the lineup. Even Baez, who was 4 for 26 with 4 singles (and 2 errors in Game 7) hit a home run off the previously impenetrable Kluber. They are even hitting Andrew Miller hard.", "Victor Mather: If this were the last time the Cubs won the World Series, the game would be over. The decisive Game 5 of that Series, in 1908, lasted 1 hour, 25 minutes. No game in the series lasted more than 2:10.", "Bottom of 5th: Lester and Ross Open Door for Indians", "The move to bring in Jon Lester as a reliever had major implications for the Cubs, mostly because of the corresponding move to put in his personal catcher, David Ross. Because of two miscues by Ross, the Indians scored two runs, cutting Chicago’s lead in half.", "Kyle Hendricks was allowed to come out to start the inning even though Jon Lester was ready in Chicago’s bullpen. He got a soft grounder to second from Coco Crisp for the first out, and struck out Roberto Perez for out two. But Hendricks walked Carlos Santana and his day was done, with Lester being summoned to face Jason Kipnis.", "Kipnis hit a soft grounder that was fielded by Ross, but the veteran who had just entered the game, threw the ball well out of Anthony Rizzo’s reach, which resulted in Francisco Lindor coming up with runners on second and third with two outs. Lester threw a ball in the dirt that caromed off of Ross’s mask and as the catcher tried to go after it, he stumbled, taking so long to recover the ball that both runners scored.", "Lester was able to strike out Lindor to end the inning, but the game certainly got more interesting.", "Because Hendricks did not pitch five innings, he is not in line for the victory should the Cubs hold on.", "David Waldstein: Lester (and to a lesser degree, Ross) coming into the game was supposed to be the Cubs’ Madison Bumgarner moment, but it looked more like an old-fashioned Cubs moment. Terrific, aggressive base running by Jason Kipnis to score from second base on a wild pitch. He never hesitated and made a beautiful slide under the tag, then got up and punched the air. Terrible inning by Ross, who made the error to allow Kipnis to get all the way to second, and then was staggered by the ball when the wild pitch hit him in the mask. It feels like a game again.", "Top of 6th: Ross Makes Up for Mistakes", "David Ross helped erase some of the damage his defense had done in the previous inning by launching a one-out home run to center field that pushed Chicago’s lead back to 6-3. Jason Heyward was the second out of the inning when he grounded out to first, and Javier Baez struck out to end the inning.", "Andrew Miller, who looked unhittable earlier in the playoffs, has now allowed two earned runs and gotten just four outs.", "David Waldstein: I promise, were not making all this up. David Ross, who is playing in his last professional baseball game at age 39, who has played on 21 different professional teams at all levels, who is the elder statesman of the Cubs, just hit his first World Series home run. It came after a wild inning behind the plate where he made one error, then got punched in the mask by a bouncing wild pitch that allowed two runs to score. Is it meant to be?", "Bottom of 6th: Indians Come Up Short", "Mike Napoli continued his struggles by striking out to lead off the half-inning. That brought up Jose Ramirez, and the third baseman grounded out to shortstop, nearly beating Addison Russell’s throw to first base that Anthony Rizzo made a great stretch on. Brandon Guyer came in as a pinch-hitter for Lonnie Chisenhall and he hit a two-out single to left, but Rajai Davis grounded out to strand him at first.", "Victor Mather: Oct. 14, 1908. Bennett Park, Detroit. Orval Overall outdueled Wild Bill Donovan, and the Cubs won the World Series. They are nine outs away from doing it again.", "Top of 7th: Cubs Chase Miller, but Fail to Score", "Dexter Fowler improved to 3 for 4 by singling to start the inning. That brought Kyle Schwarber to the plate in a tough lefty-on-lefty matchup against Andrew Miller and the ace reliever won the battle, getting Schwarber to fly out to left.", "But with that that, Miller’s day was over, with Terry Francona replacing him with the team’s closer, Cody Allen. Allen was able to strand the runner he inherited from Miller by striking out Kris Bryant, as Fowler was caught stealing after the pitch for a double play.", "While Miller is not on the hook for a loss, the game was well below his standards. He threw 43 pitches in two and one-third innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs.", "Bottom of 7th: Lester Gets Job Done", "Coco Crisp flied out to left to start the inning and then Jon Lester ran the count full against Roberto Perez before walking the catcher on the seventh pitch of the at-bat. Tyler Naquin came in as a pinch-runner for Perez before Carlos Santana hit a come-backer to Lester. The yips that have been a topic of conversation throughout the playoffs were in play as Lester barely looked at second before throwing underhand to first to get one out on a play that would have gotten two with almost any other pitcher on the mound. Lester did not end up paying for it as he struck out Jason Kipnis to end the inning.", "Top of 8th: Allen Shuts Down Cubs", "A dropped strike three forced a throw to first base, but Anthony Rizzo was easily retired to start the inning. Then Ben Zobrist looked completely overwhelmed by Cody Allen’s stuff before eventually grounding out to first. Addison Russell watched strikes one and two sail right past him before popping out to first base to end the inning. Allen has need just 17 pitches to record five outs.", "Bottom of 8th: Tie Game!", "A day after he was controversially brought into a blowout rather than being preserved for a Game 7 appearance, Aroldis Chapman proved to be human by giving up Chicago’s three-run lead in just two batters.", "Jon Lester had gotten the first two outs of the inning but was pulled from the game after Jose Ramirez hit a ball up the middle that Addison Russell couldn’t quite handle.", "Brought in for a four-out save, Chapman fired seven consecutive fastballs to Brandon Guyer, topping out at 100.3 miles per hour, but it was the last one that cost him as Guyer drove the ball to left–center for a double, bringing in a run. Chapman then imploded, allowing a two-run home run to Rajai Davis that tied the game and blew the save attempt. Coco Crisp piled on with a single but Yan Gomes, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, struck out to end the inning.", "Chapman ended up throwing 21 pitches and looked like he was completely out of gas despite the radar gun indicating he still had his velocity.", "Top of 9th: Cubs’ Squeeze Doesn’t Work", "With new life breathed into the Cleveland Indians, and rain starting to fall, Cody Allen walked the leadoff batter, David Ross, on five pitches. The Cubs looked to capitalize by bringing in Chris Coghlan as a pinch-runner for Ross, but he was erased on a force-out when Jason Heyward grounded to second base. Heyward then got something started by stealing his third base of the series, and advanced to third on a bad throw from Yan Gomes.", "Michael Martinez was brought in as a defensive replacement in right field to help prevent a sacrifice fly from scoring a run, but Shaw took care of Javier Baez by striking him out on an awkward two-strike bunt attempt. That brought up Dexter Fowler, who had been one of the Cubs’ better hitters all game, and he laced a ball up the middle that looked like it would get through before Francisco Lindor chased it down behind second base and threw Fowler out at first.", "The Indians now have a chance to win the game and the series at home in the bottom of the ninth.", "Bottom of 9th: Chapman Shuts Down Indians in 9th", "This game is headed to extra innings.", "Aroldis Chapman was back out to start the bottom of the ninth despite having looked completely worn out in the eighth. He got Carlos Santana to fly out before ending up in a long battle with Jason Kipnis. He fired Kipnis a steady diet of sliders rather than his signature heater and ended up in a full-count before slamming the door with a 97.4-mph fastball. Francisco Lindor flied out to right, ending the inning.", "Victor Mather: Extra-innings Game 7’s: 1924 Senators-Giants, 1991 Twins-Braves, 1997 Marlins- Indians. And tonight.", "Top of 10th: Rain Delay, Then Cubs Pounce", "The Cubs are back in the lead thanks to Ben Zobrist, Miguel Montero, and a couple questional intentional walks.", "After a brief rain delay, the game resumed with Kyle Schwarber facing off against Bryan Shaw. The Cubs’ designated hitter once again attacked the shift, hitting a grounder through the right side of the infield for his third hit of the game.", "Albert Almora came in as a pinch-runner for Schwarber and the move paid off when Kris Bryant hit a deep flyout to center and Almora showed off some tremendous baserunning ability by tagging up and advancing to second.", "With first base empty, Shaw intentionally walked Anthony Rizzo to get to Zobrist. The versatile veteran who won a World Series with Kansas City last year made him pay for it by driving in Almora with a double down the third-base line that energized the Cubs.", "Shaw then issued another intentional walk, this one to Addison Russell, and with the bases loaded, Miguel Montero laced a single into left that drove in Chicago’s eighth run of the game.", "Cleveland brought in Trevor Bauer with the bases loaded and one out, and the losing pitcher in Games 2 and 5 took care of business, striking out Jason Heyward and getting Javier Baez to fly out to center field to limit the damage.The Indians now have three outs to get back into the game.", "Bottom of 10th: Indians Get a Run, but Needed Two", "With one out left in the game, the Indians closed their deficit to one run but that was as close as they would get as the Cubs ended a World Series drought that had been going since 1908.", "The ending was complicated because Aroldis Chapman was out of the game after throwing 35 pitches in one and one-third innings. With their closer gone, the Cubs called on Carl Edwards Jr., a 25-year-old right-hander with 41 career regular season appearances and two career saves, to close things out. The 2011 48th-round draft pick started things off by striking out Mike Napoli swinging on a 95-mph fastball. He got Jose Ramirez to ground out to shortstop for the second out. That brought up Brandon Guyer, and Edwards walked him on five pitches.", "With Rajai Davis, who had tied the game in the eighth inning with a two-run homer, due up, Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio visited the mound. Chicago allowed Guyer to advance to second base without a throw and Davis delivered again with a single that drove Guyer in and closed the gap to one run.", "Joe Maddon was not taking any chances and he pulled the plug on his young pitcher, pulling him for Michael Montgomery with Michael Martinez due up.

The main living space stretches a generous 35 feet and combines the kitchen, dining and lounge areas. There’s a wood-burning fireplace sheathed in hand set slate tiles, and the smallish but sleek kitchen accommodates a full-range of snazzy high-quality appliances, including an integrated espresso machine.

The master suite, set privately away from the other bedrooms and lined on at least two walls with stunning, matchbook pattern wood paneling, includes a dressing hall lined with wardrobes, a laundry closet with full-sized machines and a windowless bathroom with poured concrete two-sink vanity, ebony tiled walls, a heated towel rack and a glass-enclosed multi-head shower.", "This is not the first high-priced New York City rental for the former \"Dawson’s Creek\" star who produced and co-starred in the recently released silver screen drama \"Mania Days\" and who will portray Jacqueline Kennedy in an upcoming TV miniseries (\"The Kennedys After Camelot\").

From handing $5 to a homeless person on the street in Manhattan to raising $450 to give to a working father of one in rural South Africa — we believe in the virtues of sharing abundance in an empowering fashion that enables people to decide how best to allocate their resources themselves. When we found GiveDirectly in November 2015, an org that gives $1,000, unconditionally, to people who are in extreme poverty, as a solution to get them out of extreme poverty, we fell in love. Unconditional — they can do anything they want with it — which is incredibly empowering to recipients, but many people in ‘the west’ think it’s risky...or even foolish.", "We’ve told countless friends and family about GiveDirectly, and the concept of transferring cash is met with much skepticism; soliciting responses such as \"eh, I only give people food,\" and others such as;", "\"How do they make sure people aren’t defrauding them or stealing the cash?\"", "\"I bet most people waste or squander the cash.\"", "\"It probably doesn’t have long-term impact, such as building a school could.\"", "\"General angst about the \"Savior Barbie\" complex, where western people go out to save people in poor countries by telling them what they should do — often a self-serving endeavor.\"", "...and more.", "After dealing with the frequent barrage of opposing views, but always holding strong to our personal convictions; we decided to dig for some more answers — and see how many of these holes they were poking in our own justifications could be filled. Since we currently travel abroad full-time, and Kenya is an incredible country, we decided to head out for a field visit and take a real peek under the hood of GD’s operation.", "Outside of GiveDirectly’s Country Headquarters in Kisumu, Kenya", "In August 2016, my wife and I visited GiveDirectly’s office in Kisumu, Kenya and spent two 10-hour days in the field, visiting real past recipients in the Siaya (where President Obama’s grandmother lives!) and Homa Bay regions. After meeting the team on the ground and hearing about their day to day work, we were really surprised and impressed by five main things that actually directly addressed a lot of the negative feedback we’ve heard in the past:", ") The vast majority of the team are local Kenyans; only two of around 80 or so employees are expats. We think that’s fantastic, since we’ve already known that 91% of the cash that we personally give to GD goes directly into the field, but actually a solid portion of the 9% administrative cost actually funnels into creating local jobs that afford hundreds more people in East Africa the opportunity to build bright futures for themselves. There’s a huge unemployment issue in Kenya and other East African countries and foreign investment is still far behind demand, so this kind of job creation has a huge impact on the community.", "Beyond the employment opportunity, the real incredible moments for us came when we had the chance to speak individually with a few of the locals on the team. Candidly; they are all proud to be working their asses off to improve the lives of people in their own community. We even heard two separate stories from some senior-level guys (still under 30 years old) who were driven to work at GiveDirectly after having their own first real exposure to abject poverty; even just a few miles from where they lived. They were moved to make a difference, to pour their energy every day into giving other people in their community better lives.", "Cavin Oginga (from Kenya) — A Field Ops Manager for GiveDirectly — who applied for a job there after running a research project on GiveDirectly’s work (for poverty-action.org) and seeing what a massive impact they were having.", "One of the most interesting stories we heard was about a young woman who received a cash transfer from GiveDirectly in 2014. She used a large portion of the transfer to cover her school fees so that she could complete her schooling, and then graduated and immediately sought employment. She applied to work for GiveDirectly (GD often has 200–600 applicants for any one vacancy) and she got the job. From living off of less than one dollar a day, to now being employed in one of the most competitive roles available, the cash transfer from GiveDirectly has completely altered the path of her life, and she will reach heights that only two years ago she would have thought to be completely unattainable for her.", "2.) There was really no \"savior barbie\" complex in the GiveDirectly operation — no one is coming in from wealthy nations and telling anyone else how to live their own lives and what’s best for them, and no one here is swooping in from some rich country on a self-serving mission ‘save the world.’", "3.) Auditing — The rigor behind this operation is crazy. They have 5 separate teams of people for each stage in the transfer process — from initial outreach through final follow-up, the recipients almost never see the same people, so there’s no nepotism, and absolutely everything is audited.", "4.) Let’s face it — ‘data’ is boring and unsexy, yet it’s likely the most powerful foundation for any for-profit or charitable organization to build upon. GiveDirectly is almost annoying with how data-centric they are. Every decision, literally every single question we asked them about why they do or do not do something, was backed by data. And we’re not talking about just any old data. We’re talking about peer-reviewed, audited, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — the holy grail of \"I’m right and you’re wrong.\" Not that they carry that swagger on their shoulder whatsoever (I’m humble-bragging on their behalf), but if they’re doing something, it’s because their data, and 3 other independent sources’ data has proven that’s the right decision.", "5.) The ‘mission’ per se of how GD gives isn’t about funding what they believe will have the most ‘profitable’ result, rather, funding is based on who has the greatest need. Basically it’s the ultimate \"anti\" ruthless capitalism. I loved hearing that. (i.e. not favoring a 22 year old with a bunch of entrepreneurial ideas over a 35 y/o single mother of 4)", "Richard Aura Ongari from Homa Bay, Kenya sits inside of the small two-room mud hut that he build with part of his cash transfer from GiveDirectly. The majority of his transfer has been spent on medication for a chronic illness. Before being able to afford the medication, Richard could not walk, but now that he’s being treated, you can find him marching all around his property and enjoying his life with his children and grandchildren.", "Now, for the meat of it — we went into small Kenyan villages and met these people who’ve taken a cash transfer of $1,000 (3 installments over a year). Here’s the breakdown of how their money was spent:", "1.) Housing — everyone that we met improved their housing situation in some way; they were fixing the following core issues; (and FYI we didn’t see a single home that was larger than 20 feet by 20 feet (That size home would house 5–9 people))", "This small mud shack is home to 5. Before receiving his $1,000 transfer from GiveDirectly, Samwel Odhimbo Orimba and his family lived homeless on the shores of Lake Victoria in Homa Bay, Kenya. This house, where you can see through the walls, is a major upgrade for this incredibly grateful and loving family.", "a. Thatched roof — which leaks in every rain and must be replaced every 1–3 years.", "i. Completely sleepless nights (who can sleep getting rained on?)", "ii. Leads to frequent illness / sometimes chronic, and death", "iii. Leads to missed frequently school for children", "iv. Leads to missed work and income", "b. No home — living with 4–8 people in a 10x12 one or two room mud hut", "c. Upgrading home — living in a mud hut (with holes in the walls)", "d. Dirt floor in home — constant insect infestation, including \"jigas\" which burrow in your feet causing crippling pain.", "2.) School Fees — After primary school, Kenyans have to pay $60-$70 per 3-month semester for school, given that people in extreme poverty often earn less than $5 a day for a family of 2–4 kids, that meager amount can be a mountain, forcing thousands of kids to miss out on school from 5 or 6 years old and onwards.", "3 children of GiveDirectly Recipient Eunice Awino Omondi, and 5 of their friends all living in Siaya Kenya (Where President Obama’s Grandmother lives!). Eunice’s children are now much healthier because they can sleep through the night under a steel roof, and not thatched grass that keeps them up and cold when it rains.", "3.) Food — probably the saddest of expenditures, in my opinion, but a lot of people that we met were purchasing a few month’s worth of corn to feed their families. I see it as the saddest because such a basic need, that’s consumed and gone without perpetual benefits", "Bags of corn purchased with a portion of a cash transfer from GiveDirectly that sit in the recipients doorway / living room / foyer / children's’ bedroom / guest’s bedroom", "4.) Other — Outside of those top three, which everyone seemed to have spent at least some portion of their transfer on, people purchased medicines for chronic illness (Cancer, HIV, etc), livestock for income, and clothing & shoes.", "5.) I’ll hide this little gem in here: Many skeptics think that large portions of the transfers will be wasted on vices like alcohol, drugs, or tobacco, or that the sudden influx of cash may increase a person’s propensity to seek these substances, however there is no evidence that vice consumption is different from others in the community who did not receive transfers.", "With GD’s rigorous measurement and auditing, they find the effect on vice spending (tobacco, alcohol, etc.), is \"negative and insignificant,\" meaning there is no statistically significant effect on vice consumption...Here is the 3rd party study conducted by Princeton.edu", "This finding is consistent with a publication from World Bank on vice spending and cash transfers that surveyed dozens of studies from around the world.", "Now this ended up being a pretty diverse array of purchases considering that half were from one little village, and half from another, and for us it just highlights the variety of need that exists within any small community. I think that if an organization went in to build clean water wells, offered solar panels, mosquito nets, donate clothes, built schools or built houses — only a fraction of the gross value of the investment would be felt by the people in the community. Shoving a square peg of charity into a round hole of need. This is exactly why we believe in giving cash, and why we believe in GiveDirectly. Of course these people still have needs for more, but I can confidently say that 91% of what we give them goes directly to people who need it most, and 97% of that cash transfer served immediate needs in their lives, and I don’t think other NGOs can say the same.", "I think a more open and participatory conversation on eradicating extreme poverty is critical in this day and age. Extreme poverty sits at the bottom of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and contributes to massive issues all the way up the pyramid; leading to widespread health epidemics, overpopulation, lack of education, lack of environmental and conservational awareness, increased violence and pollution. We’re all connected, and the more people who live in dignity, the better off we can all be. Do you think cash transfers are a terrible idea? Do you know of a better way?"], "targetTitle": "Here’s What Happens When You Give $1,000 to Someone in Extreme Poverty", "targetDescription": "My wife, Adrienne, and I are long-time supporters of unconditional cash giving.

A lot of people in Croatia have become alienated from the national team in recent years and there are large movements that have given up on it completely.", "They claim to have lost faith in the Croatian Football Federation and have accused it of widespread corruption. The federation’s vice-president, Zdravko Mamic, has been charged with embezzling money from Dinamo Zagreb when he was chief executive there. Damir Vrbanovic, the federation’s executive director, has also been charged as an accomplice in the same case.", "Last year, they were taken into custody (Mamic twice, as the investigation extended) amid fears that someone was trying to influence witnesses. Finally, Mamic was suspended from working at Dinamo by the authorities but both men kept their job at the federation and were both in the VIP lounge at the game against the Czechs.", "Many fans in Croatia feel the national team has been hijacked by the pair – as well as Davor Suker, the CFF president who is seen by many as their puppet – and turned it into a tool for making money. Mamic and Vrbanovic deny this but there has been a long – and at the moment unsuccessful – campaign to have them removed via the legal system.", "Croatia fans fight among themselves following the disruption to Friday’s match.", "Some radical fans are so captivated by the hatred towards the CFF that they do not even mind if they are hurting the team with their actions. In fact, it goes further than that. They are now actively trying to sabotage the team, as they feel that international shame and on-pitch failure is the only chance for changes to finally take place in Croatian football.", "Their aim may be to introduce more democracy and transparency in domestic football, a chance to start afresh, but their methods are all wrong. Other fans, who still support the team, started a scuffle with them in the stands after the flares were thrown. It is a sad indictment of the whole society that it has come to this.", "Among the players and coaching staff on Friday night the sense was one of utter disillusionment. Croatia have four points after two games but no one was talking about the 2-2 draw against the Czech Republic . \"Maybe it would be best if we don’t play at all,\" said Ivan Perisic, who scored the opening goal for Croatia. \"Maybe that would actually be better in case these things are going to happen every time we play.\"", "The coach, Ante Cacic, added: \"We are all to blame.

{"uuid": "40258287-e2f2-4491-81ca-fb8f40f6629a", "postId": "4yjpbz", "postText": ["Why Women Are No Longer Catching Up To Men On Pay"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["If you were an American man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars). If you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you’d still be making about the same — a bit more than $22 per hour.", "Fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour. Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.)", "Notice that I said \"men.\" Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall.", "The gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. (These calculations don’t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) More recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: In 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade.", "Other measures of women’s progress in the workforce — their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies — show a similar pattern of what researchers Martha J. Bailey and Thomas A. DiPrete, in a new essay, call \"five decades of remarkable but slowing change\" for American women.", "Bailey and DiPrete’s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the Russell Sage Foundation that examines the progress that women have — and haven’t — made over the past half-century. It isn’t a simple story. The U.S. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality — explicit discrimination on pay, overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. What is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure.", "Take the long-hours anecdote I described above. The rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the Russell Sage Foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn’t occurred. But that premium itself isn’t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average).", "Rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. That, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the American economy and society: Women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men — especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men — are expected to work as much as possible. And of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. Government policies could make a difference — affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so — but they can only go so far.", "The Russell Sage Foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. A rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by \"pre-market\" factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men — there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates — yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. Girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. And the overall rate of \"occupational desegregation\" — women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa — has slowed.", "There are some encouraging signs for women. Those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn’t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called STEM fields. Moreover, the \"motherhood penalty\" — the relative decline in wages for women when they have children — has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. That suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too — something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. Culture is changing, too: Men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal.", "Still, the overall picture painted by the Russell Sage Foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. Hillary Clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off.", "The Olympic tax", "Speaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast Simone Biles and other Olympic medalists will face when they get back from Rio. The BBC estimated Biles will owe more than $40,000. A bipartisan bill to exempt Olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in Congress.", "But the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. The U.S. Olympics Committee awards bonuses to American medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. Biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. (The medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) But it’s unlikely she’ll actually owe that much because Biles and other Olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. And in the case of high-profile Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. By the time Biles cashes all those checks from Procter & Gamble, her Olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error.", "The Fed", "Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting this week suggest that Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in September or wait until the economy improves further. Separate comments from key Fed officials this week indicated that new data since the Fed’s meeting hasn’t resolved the question.", "The Fed is in a tricky spot. The job market continues to show strength; May’s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending — a key pillar of strength in recent months — is beginning to weaken. Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed’s task in two ways: Policymakers don’t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates.", "Number of the week", "Back in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. The report didn’t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers."], "targetTitle": "Why Women Are No Longer Catching Up To Men On Pay", "targetDescription": "This is In Real Terms, a column analyzing the week in economic news.

Costco members who have Costco AmEx accounts should have already been sent new Costco Visa cards in the mail automatically.", "In many ways, the card change works to the benefit of Costco members. The new Visa cards provide members with 4% cash back on up to $7,000 of gas purchases annually, plus 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back for Costco purchases, and 1% back on everything else. The old Costco AmEx card, by comparison, gave 3% cash back on gas purchases up to $4,000 annually.", "In the case of both of the new and old Costco-affiliated credit cards, the cash back can be redeemed only at Costco. What’s more, Costco now accepts any Visa card, so you don’t need to use the one the retailer sent as a replacement for the old AmEx card.", "And there may be times when you probably should use a non-Costco Visa card for your Costco purchases. For instance, the Chase Freedom Visa card is offering an outstanding 5% cash back on purchases at warehouse clubs such as Costco, BJ’s, and Sam’s Club. The cash back applies to purchases up to $1,500 per quarter, and while the cash back offer was originally only supposed to apply to the second quarter of 2016, it’s been extended to the entire year", "So, looking ahead, Chase Freedom cardholders have the possibility of earning 5% cash back on up to $1,500 worth of Costco purchases (for a total of $75 back) during the third quarter (July 1 to September 30), and again during the fourth quarter (October 1 to December 31).

In this collection of still lifes on Vice’s Creators, photographer Ambera Wellmann whimsically plays with these emotions by creating a photo project best described as uncomfortable. There’s something deeply troubling about these pictures, and while I can’t exactly put my thumb on it, the collection constitutes a great example of creativity in young photographers today.", "—G.H.S.", "7. \"Mozart in Nairobi’s Korogocho Slum\" — Al Jazeera", "The most striking thing in this photo essay is how Eva de Vries placed the children with their instruments in the middle of the slum. There’s quietness and serenity amid everything that’s not. By doing so, de Vries encapsulated the message of the story in her portraits: the impact that music has had in the lives of these children.", "—A.M.", "8. \"Women Photograph: War, Weddings and Nightclub Queues\" — The Guardian", "This feature showcases the undeniably extensive ways in which female photographers have made an impact.

That last detail is especially important for retirees who haven't saved as much as they had hoped. Fortunately, there are a number of countries where you can retire comfortably with a smaller nest egg. Living on the cheap is even easier when you're receiving Social Security benefits. As of 2016, the retirement plan, that, along with your Social Security payments, should be enough to last three decades in the following eight international locales.", "1. Ecuador © Gabrielle & Michel Therin-Weise/Getty Images Expatriates flock to Ecuador because of its gorgeous landscape, superior healthcare system and the generous government benefits extended to retirees, including discounts on utilities and public transportation. Housing is a steal in the capital city of Quito, with the monthly rent for a furnished, 900-square-foot apartment start at just $538. Utilities run $53 a month on average. Overall, Ecuador has a cost of living that's 58% cheaper than New York City.", "2. Nicaragua © Tan Yilmaz/Getty Images Nicaragua is located in the heart of Central America, and it's a premier retirement destination if you're looking for an excellent quality of life without a high price tag. The Nicaraguan government offers a number of financial incentives to attract foreign retirees, such as a sales tax exemption on construction materials if you're building a home. You need to be at least 45 years old and have a minimum monthly income of $600 to qualify, which may be appealing if you're considering an early retirement.

Belize © Kelley Miller/National Geographic RF/Getty Images Palm trees, blue skies and sandy beaches are some of the best reasons to retire in Belize, as is the fact that it's extremely budget-friendly. Housing in Belize City is dirt cheap, with a 900-square-foot furnished rental going for as little as $377 a month. The Qualified Retired Persons Incentive Program makes it even more attractive for retirees age 45 and up since any income earned from sources outside Belize is 100% tax-free.", "5. Panama © Susan Leggett/Alamy Panama proves to be exceptionally welcoming for retirees from all parts of the globe who come in search of a tropical atmosphere. Prices in Panama City tend to be on par with what you'd pay in the U.S., but you'll find that the surrounding smaller towns and villages are much more affordable. The Pensionado Program saves foreign retirees some extra cash by offering discounts on flights, hospital services, utilities and more.", "6. Costa Rica © billberryphotography/Getty Images Costa Rica is popular with tourists, but certain areas, such as the Central Valley region and the southern coast, are ideally suited for establishing permanent residence on a shoestring.

Utilities typically run between $48 and $79 per month, so it's definitely possible to make your retirement savings stretch.", "7.

{"uuid": "b0d2ad72-89c7-415b-9cb4-75b966c35e74", "postId": "4l2uha", "postText": ["A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave in France"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Some 336 meters into the cave, the caver stumbled across something extraordinary—a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken. Most of the 400 pieces had been arranged into two rings—a large one between 4 and 7 metres across, and a smaller one just 2 metres wide. Others had been propped up against these donuts. Yet others had been stacked into four piles. Traces of fire were everywhere, and there was a mass of burnt bones.", "These weren’t natural formations, and they weren’t the work of bears. They were built by people. Recognizing the site’s value, the caver brought in archaeologist Francois Rouzaud. Using carbon-dating, Rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. It also meant that they couldn’t have been the work of Homo sapiens. Their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of France at the time: Neanderthals. The discovery suggested that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? Rouzaud would never know. In April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. With his death, work on the Bruniquel Cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected. They’ve only now re-entered the limelight because Sophie Verheyden went on holiday. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible.\" A life-long caver, Verheyden works at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites. She treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia. So when she learned about Bruniquel Cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: Why hadn’t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves?\"", "She knew that Rouzaud’s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect. Carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the Bruniquel material was hitting the technique’s limits. They could well have been much older. To get a better estimate, Verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist Jacques Jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert Dominique Genty. In 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves. \"I’m not very big, and I had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through,\" says Verheyden. \"It’s kind of magical, even without the structures.\" After drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers. On one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave’s former users. By measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction. Their date? 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible,\" says Verheyden. Outside Bruniquel Cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old. Most of these are ruins—collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers. By comparison, the Bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient.", "And if Rouzaud’s work made it unlikely that modern humans built the rings, Verheyden’s study grinds that possibility into the dust. Neanderthals must have been responsible. There simply wasn’t any other hominin in that region at that time. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious.\" Why did they build the rings and mounds? The structures weren’t foundations for huts; the chamber contains no stone tools, human bones, or any other sign of permanent occupation, and besides, why build shelter inside a cave? \"A plausible explanation is that this was a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior,\" says Paola Villa from the University of Colorado Museum. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious, but that’s not proven,\" adds Verheyden. Indeed, despite some fanciful speculations about cave bear cults, no one really knows. Nor is it clear how the Neanderthals made the structures. Verheyden says it couldn’t have been one lone artisan, toiling away in the dark. Most likely, there was a team, and a technically skilled one at that.

When I pointed out that the Ginsberg, wasn't exactly a connoisseur of mainstream tastes, Radcliffe defended the \"Harry Potter\" franchise. The 24-year-old may be moving on from Hogwarts, but he certainly hasn't forgotten, nor dismissed, where he came from.", "Not only do you have \"Kill Your Darlings\" coming out this year, but you also starred in the Toronto International Film Festival debuts, \"Horns\" and \"The F Word.\" It's not easy to redefine yourself from Harry Potter, but it appears it's happening.", "I think it depends on the attitude you take towards it, basically. If you say, yes, \"Potter\" was the biggest thing that I'm ever going to do and I'm never going to come close to that again, and it's going to hold me back from getting parts, then probably all of those things will come true. But if you take the attitude that this is the most amazing platform, in a way, to get set for a career in the world, it's an amazing start to have had and it's something that can be capitalized on rather than being something that holds you back. And I just have such fun doing my job, as well. Like, the most interesting way for me to do it is by picking diverse, varied things -- like \"The F Word\" and \"Kill Your Darlings.\"", "And I think there's definitely an element of you grow up for 10 years on a set and you don't really have peers when you're 12 or 13 that you look to in other films. When you're 16 or 17, you start becoming aware of guys like Aaron Johnson or Eddie Redmayne or Ben Whishaw or James McAvoy. And you start being fans of them and you also start kind of going, \"Oh, I want to do what they're doing. I want to have loads of different parts as well.\" So it builds up this desire to get out there.", "\"The Woman in Black\" felt like its narrative was basically, \"Here's Daniel Radcliffe's first post-Potter role,\" and now, with these, people have moved on.", "I think that's a really astute observation. I think that's completely true. \"The Woman in Black\" was a fantastic transition because it wasn't so different than Harry that people were like, \"Oh, he's just trying to shock us.\" But it was different enough that people realized it was a different reason to go and see it. And the fact that it did so well and it was a really good movie. I may not be over the moon with my own performance in it -- there's still stuff I see when I see that that's very reminiscent of Harry. I only started filming it six weeks or something after we finished the last \"Potter.\" So, it came very soon after. But I do think, now, with these next three films, people will see it is so different from anything I've done before. I just think I've grown up a lot as an actor in the last couple of years. And I think, as a consequence, my work's gotten better and I'm just looking forward to people finally seeing it because I feel like I've been talking about this film for ages and now people will get to verify for themselves.", "And you're playing a guy who is part of a group that despises mainstream tastes.", "[Laughs] Yes. Yeah, I know what you mean. But, you know, I think that's what I liked about Potter and that's what I'm still very proud of about Potter. Even though it was the most commercial series in the world -- in terms of the money it made and the appeal it had -- we always did try to make them as challenging as possible. I think the reason I'm so proud of it, still, is that we made eight films that got better and better and better until the last one. That's not very often achieved in film and the fact we achieved it is a testament to the amount of care and love put into it by everyone who was involved on that set, all the time. So, yeah, I still think we did a remarkable thing and even if we were very mainstream -- which, of course, we were -- we brought a lot of integrity and sort of a boldness to the franchise. Because, when I was growing up, I don't remember people talking about franchises before I was in one. I remember people talking about \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Potter\" would be like \"franchises\" that's the first time I remember ...", "Last time we spoke you mentioned you had never watched \"Star Wars.\"", "Yes.", "Well, except for \"The Phantom Menace.\"", "Let's not tell anyone that.", "You have to catch up before \"Episode VII\" comes out.", "I know! I know I do. I have to catch up before that because fucking all of my friends are working on the new one. Because \"Star Wars\" is filming in Leavesden. There was at least one guy, Digby Milner, who worked on all the \"Potters\" who had also worked on \"Star Wars,\" the originals. And he will be working on new \"Star Wars\" at Leavesdon as well. And it is kind of amazing because \"Star Wars,\" the originals, were made in England as well. So there's a lot of that crew who we'll basically have a huge amount of sons and daughters of the original crew who are now on the new \"Star Wars\" movie.", "It's come full circle.", "That's all they do at Leavesdon, apparently, is franchises [laughs].", "\"Kill Your Darlings\" is interesting because it involves famous people in a story that's really not that well known.", "I mean, I didn't know the story at all. I really wasn't aware of it. That's one of the things that's so cool about it -- and cool about reading the script for the first time is you just go, \"Wow.\" When you have a story that is this fascinating about a group of characters that is this well known -- and, yet, this story has really never been told -- you start of just feel like this is buried treasure we've struck.", "Allen Ginsberg wanted to write a book about this at one point and he was told not to.", "Absolutely. Lucien, for reasons you understand when you see the film, did not want anyone to know this story. But I definitely think that was one of the fascinating things about it: people didn't know. And one of the things I think people will like about this film that I think, perhaps, they won't expect is that when you hear \"1940s Beat poet historical drama,\" you sort of think, Oh, that sounds quite dry. But it's actually a lot of fun as well. I don't think you can make a movie about the Beats without having fun -- because they had a great fucking time.", "This might be a bad comparison, but it's got a superhero origin story feel to it, only with writers.", "Oh, I've said that a lot.", "Like when we're introduced to Jack Kerouac, it felt dramatic.", "And the first time we see Allen's name in the film is on his university application. [Director] John Krokidas loved the idea of taking this famous person's name, but actually seeing it in the context of them applying to university.", "What was your reaction when you heard J.K. Rowling was revisiting the \"Harry Potter\" universe with \"Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them\"? Were you surprised?", "I had never heard her say \"no.\" I don't think any of us would ever be foolish enough to, you know, say never. But, I think with Jo, I wasn't really surprised. It kind of made sense to me actually, when it was announced. Because I was kind of like, \"OK, yeah, she's gone off and had 'Casual Vacancy' and then done the Robert Galbraith books -- and both have been very successful. And I imagine that has given her a confidence of, \"Oh, OK, now that I stepped away from it, I can actually go back to it with confidence.\" And I think she recognizes that there is still a huge hunger out there for more sides of the \"Potter\" world. And, yeah, she's wants to give people what they want. And I think it will be really good. I'm just relieved that it's in her hands, to be honest. That lets me know that it's not anyone just cashing in and it's going to be authentic.", "She doesn't need the money.", "She definitely doesn't need the money.", "Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment.

It's kind of like ordering a triple cheeseburger with a Diet Coke, you know? Hashtag pointless. Although, if it makes a national debut, we're not going to complain.", "Oh, Taco Bell. You beautiful hot mess, you. Forget Beefy Crunch Burritos ; T-Bell just rolled out a new menu item called the Jalapeno Popper Quesarito. Like many of their shock-inducing new additions, it appears to be in the testing phase. If you can book a ticket to Charlotte, North Carolina, Brand Eating says you'll find one there.

Ask any true Roman about it and you'll be met with a befuddled \"who is-a Alfredo?\" That's because, fellow Americans, Roman children didn't grow up scarfing down plates of this creamy comfort food like we did here. (Then again, Olive Garden has yet to hit Mediterranean shores.) Alfredo, after all, isn't found alongside carbonara and amatriciana in the pantheon of celebrated local dishes—not because it isn't Roman, but because it never spread throughout the city. Its origins lay in a single, no-name trattoria on a side street near the Trevi Fountain. In the early 1900s, the eponymous Alfredo di Lielo needed a calorific meal to feed his pregnant wife. So he combined butter and cheese and melted it over fettuccine noodles. Sated, his wife insisted he add it to his menu.", "But it remained a strictly of-the-house specialty. Despite the acclaim (rumors swirl that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate it on their Roman holiday in 1927), other trattorias likely rejected it due to inauthenticity. Alfredo used parmigiano for the cheese (a bold move in Pecorino Romano country) and butter, which was pretty much as foreign an ingredient to Italians at the time as milk was to the Japanese. But it did take off stateside thanks to a Pennsylvania noodle company: Pennsylvania Dutch marketed a creamy sauce called Alfredo after influential New York restaurateur George Renart raved about the dish in the Saturday Evening Post when he returned from a trip to Rome. The version we eat now—loaded with cream, often with chicken—is a bastardization of what Alfredo cooked up a century ago. And it's definitely not what you would find in Rome now, even if those trattorias from Testaccio to Prati had Alfredo on the menu (which they don't).", "Should we just quit the search and make do with carbonara instead? Local food expert Elizabeth Minchilli says no way. \"I always encourage travelers to seek out Alfredo in Rome,\" she says. \"You just need to know where to go.\" That would be Trattoria della Scrofa, between Piazza Navona and the Trevi Fountain, a 103-year-old restaurant that Alfredo started after his first spot was flattened to make space for a shopping center. What you’ll get is a heaping plate of pasta prepped as Alfredo did it all those years ago: hot noodles, on a hot plate, mixed with (lots of) softened butter and (lots of) grated parmigiano right at your table. What you won’t get is cream, garlic, or an overwhelming crush of travelers.

Sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a Trump presidency. A new Slate podcast is called Time to Panic . Number cruncher Nate Silver, who gives Trump a 40% probability of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had \"Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump’s chances. Same mistake as primaries, Brexit.\"", "Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial as they are about Trump’s chances. Same mistake as Brexit Nate Silver", "The source of the alarm is not so much the national polls, where Clinton is a few points ahead, but surveys from those battleground states where the presidency will be decided. In the last week, polls have put Trump in front in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and, most neuralgic of all, Florida.", "So low are expectations for his performance on Monday – where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him – that if Trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to Clinton’s face, his advocates will declare that he looked \"presidential\" and anoint him the winner. If he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle.", "And for all her experience, Clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. She’s been advised that she mustn’t interrupt too much or talk over Trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way. According to a New York Times report well sourced from inside Hillary’s debate preparation team, \"she does not want to be seen as pushy and play into gender stereotypes\". This was not something Barack Obama, or husband Bill, ever had to worry about.", "Activists in Berlin dismantle what they called a Wall of Hate showing Donald Trump in front of the Brandenburg Gate on 23 September.", "But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies? One reporter following Trump has taken to logging the falsehoods he tells each day: no small task.", "Take two areas where you’d assume that to be caught in untruth would be terminal for a presidential candidate. Trump has been exposed for serial lying over 9/11 , falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort. He even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund.", "This week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. Earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others’ donations, to pay for a larger than life $10,000 painting – of himself. He lies about 9/11. He lies about charity. But on he strides.", "But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?’", "So where can Hillary begin? If she calls him a liar, he’ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her Crooked Hillary, knowing that some 60% of Americans believe she’s dishonest. The risk is that he’ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct.", "If that sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a show we’ve already seen. In 2000 Al Gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. But he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping George W Bush. Never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the US into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. On the night, Bush came across better on TV.", "Which brings us to a core problem facing Hillary Clinton. Polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that Trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for America’s highest office – but who are refusing to back Clinton. One survey of 18- to 34-year-olds recorded dire numbers for Trump, but still found only 31% supporting Clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian Gary Johnson and 15% the Green candidate Jill Stein. If those numbers are replicated on election day, Trump will win.", "This too stirs queasy memories of 2000. In that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for Ralph Nader instead of Gore. More than 90,000 voted for Nader in Florida, a state Gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. Had even a tiny fraction of those Naderites decided to hold their nose and choose Gore instead, there would have been no Bush presidency – and no Iraq war.", "I know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose Nader, who to this day blame Gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). But the basic case is surely clear. In a two-party system like America’s, if you want to stop Trump, then a vote for Johnson or Stein will not do it. Only a vote for Clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next US president.", "You might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. But 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don’t remember it. And here, younger voters are not to blame. Older liberals haven’t seared the Bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. They never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. As the New Republic put it this week, \"Liberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of George W Bush.\" (Republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of Jimmy Carter to this day, just as British Conservatives invoked the 1979 \"winter of discontent\" for over three decades. It is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents’ history of failure.)", "So now, even though the hour is late, this is the case Democrats must make. That this is an exceptional election because Donald Trump represents an exceptional menace, to America and to the world. It is indeed a referendum on Trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote Clinton. She may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she’s all that stands between you and an American nightmare.", "You don’t have to love her. You don’t even have to like her. You’re not saying she’s flawless (though the current Democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of Bernie Sanders).

Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that there are no universal \"best times\" to share content on Facebook.", "We analyzed the median traffic that articles received from Facebook three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year’s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn’t skewed by outliers. Our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries.", "Firstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in South America, France and the U.K., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher.", "As can be seen in the above chart, the South American publisher achieved best performance when sharing between 11am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times. The British and French publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both experienced peaks in referral traffic at different times.", "It’s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category — optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience. One explanation for this could be that daily routines and behaviors vary between countries and cultures, which therefore impacts media consumption patterns.", "The natural next question is whether there are country-wide best times for posting stories on Facebook. Could it be that readers in France all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the South Americans? Can there be specific guides per country?", "We compared traffic data from that same French news publisher with a top-10 French sports publisher of similar size and found that while before 10am they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge. By early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough.", "Overall, the sports publisher’s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories. Even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country, there are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content.", "We also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 French news publishers. There were still crucial differences — when one publisher experienced a peak in share performance at 11am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing.", "Interestingly, there also seems to be significant variance based on article topic. We looked at 220,000 Facebook posts made by our publisher clients between March 20 and July 10, 2016, and sorted them according to the time of day at which they were shared. We then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. All shares were obtained using local time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume.", "Again, there are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day.", "But even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice. To get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time basis due to strong daily fluctuations. Indeed this is why many publishers now commit very significant resource to optimizing their performance — with large social media teams and even data scientists.", "Featured Image: Nick Shepherd/Getty Images"], "targetTitle": "When’s the best time to share on Facebook?", "targetDescription": "There’s all manner of advice and guidance on the web for online publishers looking to optimize their social media efforts: CoSchedule, Fast Company,..", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/messenger.jpg?w=150", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/facebook-messenger.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/b?c1=2&c2=6036210&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=1.3&cj=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/crunch-network.jpg", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/brandbastion_logo.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/messenger-reactions.png?w=150", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/logo.svg", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/100x75.png", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/techcrunch_transparent_google_editor_picks.png", "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/sport_technology.png?w=738&h=416", "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/frenchnewsandfrenchsports-1.png?w=738&h=416", "https://img.vidible.tv/prod/2017-03/03/58b9fa77d85a105723655d89/58b9fad540752f4c6f8238c1_o_U_v1.jpg?w=300&h=170", "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/postingtime.jpg?w=738", "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/facebook-city-guides.png?w=150", "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/postingtime.jpg?w=764&h=400&crop=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png", "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ap-data.png?w=150", "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/threenewspublishers_differentregions_version1.png?w=738&h=416", "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/twoleadingfrenchnewspublishers-1.png?w=738&h=416"], "targetUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/10/whens-the-best-time-to-share-on-facebook/?ncid=rss", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "We don't know.", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["It’s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category — optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience.

According to a recent study at the University of Chicago, sleep deprivation is also the cause of an increase in the appetite for salty and sweet treats. The results are quite substantial, going into the link between obesity and sleep deprivation.", "Just by depriving oneself of sleep, one can experience an increase in appetite a lot like the one experienced after getting stoned. The results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint.", "Conducting the study", "The University of Chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university. The researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes. The researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm.", "After the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose. They included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food. They found that those that were sleep deprived were far less likely to resist the offer of snacks, and their urge to binge on them was highest in the afternoon right through to the early evening.", "Sleep deprivation and obesity", "It has long been believed that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and this study can confirm the very reason that they may be linked. Depriving the human body of sleep interfere’s with its production of hormones that control things like appetite and satiety.", "The scientists conducting this study looked into the kind of hormones that were present in the blood during the study. They looked specifically at the hormones ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin is the hormone that deals with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tells the brain when the body is full of food.", "The endocannabinoid system", "Finally, the scientists decided that they would delve a little further into the body’s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system, the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana. Erin Hanlon, who lead the study, found that there was a certain endocannabinoid that was increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite.", "Endocannabinoid 2-AG is the chemical that increases the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat, and is an endocannabinoid that also increases after the use of marijuana. \"We know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and causes people to overeat when they are not hungry, and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty foods,\" Hanlon said. \"Sleep restriction may cause overeating by acting in the same manner.\"", "So it seems that sleep deprivation has a very similar effect on the body in terms of appetite as using marijuana does. This means that a future of dealing with obesity through medicine that targets the endocannabinoid system is possible, although much more consideration would be required before moving into it.", "Do you experience the munchies when you are sleep deprived?

Wilder died at the age of 83 on Sunday, due to complications from Alzheimer’s disease at his home in Stamford, Connecticut.", "Without Wilder the film may have been good, but with him, it was wonderful.

As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I’m walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause.\"", "When asked why he wanted to do this, Wilder simply said, \"Because from that time on, no one will know if I’m lying or telling the truth.\"", "Wilder wanted Wonka to be completely unpredictable, and as we all know, he got his wish.

Not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip, and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane. And yes, it’s OK to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon.", "Also, if your salon offers free bang touch-ups, consider bringing a few dollars to leave as a thank-you gesture. Your stylist will look fondly on you next time you come into the salon.", "If you’re a woman with shorter hair — meaning you get it cut and/or colored regularly — your stylists will understand if you offer a slightly smaller tip. After all, your annual bill is much higher than a longer-haired client’s.", "As for tipping on a discounted service: Stylists are split on the issue, with some suggesting a 20% tip on the original price of the service, and others saying a tip of 20% on the discounted rate is fine, since the goal is to get you back into the salon. When in doubt, ask at the front desk!", "Finally, if you’re unsatisfied with your haircut, communicated what you wanted to your stylist, and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused to make changes, you can definitely lower your tip.

It’s surprisingly easy to make a name for yourself and garner 15 minutes of fame.", "The newest member of the \"Gone Viral\" club is none other than Texas native Candace Payne. A wife of nearly 15 years and mom to two youngsters, Payne seemed to be all over your Facebook Newsfeed and everywhere else on the internet over the last few days when a Facebook Live video of her unboxing a \"Chewbacca\" mask and laughing hysterically went mega viral.", "We’re talking – \"It broke the internet.\"", "Literally, Candace Payne’s video has set new records as being the most-viewed Facebook Live video with over 133 MILLION views.", "But just hours after her video blew up the internet, Payne goes on record with the real reason she put on that mask, and we – for the first time – have begun to understand why Candace’s little stunt is about more than just a funny moment dressed as Chewbacca in the front seat of a car.", "She walked into Kohl’s to buy yoga pants, but little did Candace know that God had other plans for her.", "\"I honestly wasn’t there for the mask,\" Payne told \"I honestly wasn’t there for the mask,\" Payne told Good Morning America . \"I was there for myself for some yoga pants because I’m trying to work out more. And it’s not really going that well, but I ended up going to the toy section because I got discouraged about the yoga pants and I thought, ‘Maybe not today. But I can get a toy for my kids.’ And I walk through the toy section and I accidentally bumped my shoulder into this box. And I had seen this before, but I didn’t realize it made sounds until that moment. It accidentally started making the growl, and I went, ‘I need to get that. Like, I don’t think my kids need that, I think I need that.’\"", "A few minutes later, Candace is in her car only 30 minutes away from needing to be \"responsible\" as she puts it, and pick up her children from school. But with only a few minutes to spare, she couldn’t contain herself and decided to do an ‘unboxing’ in her car and show her friends on Facebook her new find.", "So with a smile that’s worth more than its weight in gold, she introduced herself to the interwebs and began to take the \"Chewie\" mask out of the box and put it on.", "Then laughter ensued. Candace says she tipped her head back and caught a glimpse of herself in the rearview mirror and she couldn’t contain the belly laugh that came out of her. And as she saw the reactions of people responding live to her post, she got even more vivacious. To the point that she couldn’t stop laughing and tears flowed out of her eyes.", "I was struck by a very distinct feeling the first time I watched Candace’s hilarious video. I’ve seen plenty of viral videos before — in fact, it’s a part of my job. But something is different about Candace Payne.", "\"For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\" -Romans 14:17", "Candace is no ordinary \"15-minute-famer.\" In fact, it wouldn’t surprise me if Candace’s influence extends long past 15 minutes.", "Not only is Payne adorable and obviously so much fun, it turns out that she’s someone who loves Jesus too. And boy does it show. Candace is active in her church, The Oaks Fellowship in Red Oak, Texas (just outside of Dallas) and she’s a dedicated wife and momma.", "Just 48 hours after her video had gone viral, Candace got up on stage with a message to young creatives at an Arts conference in Texas, and gave nuggets of wisdom that are clearly directly from Heaven.", "\"When I was 16, I had a vision and a dream from the Lord about my future being used for His glory. I didn’t understand the interpretation of it. I still to this day, at 37-years-old, try to figure that dream out. But that dream has never left my heart, nor my mind, nor the way that I walk and follow Jesus. And I know that God has gifted me in many different areas and sometimes, I feel like I wake up and I’m a Jack-of-many-trades and a master-of-none because I have that creative buzz in me, constantly going,\" said Candace.", "But here’s where her words get really good.", "\"It doesn’t matter how talented, how anointed, how gifted, how passionate, or how willing you are if you’re not fit to do the things that God has called you to do... And that is spiritually fit. The thing that will take you further and farther in the Kingdom of God is three things: diligence, patience, and obedience... Do not try to make a name for yourself. His name will always outshadow yours.\" -Candace Payne", "And that’s not all of the mic drop moments Candace spoke. Take a look at her whole encouragement to the kids at the Regional Fine Arts event:", "\"I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in Him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.\" -Romans 15:13", "One of the markers of Jesus’ work in your life is that you have joy. It doesn’t mean that you never feel sad or have a bad day, but it does mean that an unspeakable exuberance and delight fills you that sometimes there aren’t words to explain.", "Often, a hallmark of the Holy Spirit’s work in your life is joy. And many times that comes in the form of laughter — deep, beautiful laughter — that not only releases joy in you, but in the lives of others.", "Candace Payne’s video went viral not just because she’s delightful and hilarious and so much fun to watch (although all of those things are true). Her video caught the attention of millions of people because she is FILLED with the love and joy of Jesus. And God used a beautiful daughter from Texas, in a Chewbacca mask; deciding to look past her discouragement about not finding yoga pants that fit, and find happiness in something as simple as a plastic Star Wars toy to bring joy to people’s lives.", "\"Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord’s people.\" -Philemon 1:7", "Don’t believe me? As if the record-breaking 133 Million views isn’t enough (that’s more views than Mark Zuckerberg has friends, by the way), then listen to the response of people who watched her video:", "Candace shared on Candace shared on Good Morning America that the best note she received as a result of her video is from a mom who has a daughter with autism who laughed over and over for the first time in over two months as she watched Candace’s hilarious stunt.", "\"From one mama heart to another mama, to see a child laugh that you haven’t seen laugh, those are the stories that I’m going to take with me everyday,\" said Candace.", "The world is hungry — no, they’re starving — for the joy of the Lord. The Bible says that His joy is our strength. If you are lacking joy in your life, start by asking God to give you His joy and then belly-laugh along with Candace. Then go and spread your joy with others and you’ll find that your joy will be always flowing.", "And apparently Candace agrees with me as she said this morning on Good Morning America :", "\"I think the world as a whole, is in need of a good laugh. I think we’re in need of somebody to lift our spirits, to not take ourselves too seriously and to break some cynicism — worldwide.\"", "Thank you so much Candace Payne for sharing the joy of the Lord that is inside of you with the world. You have no idea how inspiring you really are... Or maybe you do since you let the fruit of the Spirit come out of you so freely.

One thing is sure, though: While Donald Trump has thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible, even he has limits.", "The reality is that Trump—like policymakers and politicians past, present and future—is operating within the confines of the Overton Window of Political Possibility.", "The Overton Window: When You Think About It, It’s So True...", "This theory, named for the late Joseph P. Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate. The Overton Window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters. Although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window.", "For example, consider federal welfare policy. Even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty in the United States, politicians support and debate only a select few, such as the minimum wage, earned income tax credit, Medicaid, etc. These are within the Overton Window. Other ideas, such as a guaranteed basic income, even though they may be debated in other countries and supported by economists on both the left and the right, are never seriously considered by politicians because they lie outside the window.", "Trump’s Public Policy, Explained", "With this in mind, now consider Trump’s recent about-face after he said the victims of the recent Orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry guns into the Pulse nightclub. About a week after making the statement, Trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employees and guards should have been armed, not patrons.", "This wasn’t just a flip-flop or mere pandering — it’s more likely that Trump’s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance was a step outside the Overton Window. While many of his supporters are no doubt staunch believers in the Second Amendment, even the NRA—which endorsed him—said, \"No one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms.\"", "Using the Overton Window Theory to Your Advantage", "It is important to remember that politicians rarely move the window; more often than not, they only support policies that are deemed acceptable by their constituents. When Trump said Orlando nightclub patrons should have been armed, the backlash showed him that position was outside the window, so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voters.", "The lesson in all this is that politicians, as Friedrich Hayek once wrote, are like corks bobbing in the sea. They only go where the current leads them, and it is us — you, me and our neighbors — who determine the direction of the current. In other words, if you want to see policy change—if you want to expand the Overton Window—appeal to the hearts and minds of your fellow citizens and the politicians will soon follow."], "targetTitle": "How One Theory You Never Heard of Explains Everything Donald Trump Does", "targetDescription": "When Donald Trump declared his candidacy for president a year ago, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight political blog said he had \"a better chance of cameoing in another ‘Home Alone’ movie with...", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/logo-white.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=656781714423399&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/ihs-logo-white-stacked.svg", "http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/signup-bar/signup-cookie.png", "http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/logo-no-tagline.svg", "http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/logo.svg", "http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Lovell-150x150.jpg", "http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trump-1200X675-2-1024x576.png"], "targetUrl": "http://www.learnliberty.org/blog/how-one-theory-you-never-heard-of-explains-everything-donald-trump-does/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=blog+16%2C+unknown+theory+explains+trump%2C+hayek+quote%2C+repost%2C+8%2F29%2F2016&amp;utm_campaign=blog+16", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "There's a spectrum his positions, however incoherent at first sight, can flip to and flop from without consequence", "spoilerPublisher": "savedyouaclick"}, "spoiler": ["The Overton Window"], "spoilerPositions": [[[4, 0], [4, 18]]], "tags": ["phrase"]}

Although the correction was very uniform across the items I sampled, most items have not continued to drop in value, and many have risen back to their pre-announcement price.

Well maybe now we’ve sparked your curiosity.", "They don’t fart—detectably. There’s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn’t seem like anyone has ever truly observed—or more importantly, measured—a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate?", "As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don’t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird’s gastrointestinal tract, he’d be concerned something was wrong with the bird.", "But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there’s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected.", "In another blog post, she describes the only written account she’s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master’s thesis on blue jays.", "One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas.", "Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod’s observation.) He also acknowledges that the \"wisp of whitish gas\" could also have simply been water vapor—steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog’s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)", "It’s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that \"the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment\" and break down into its smellier components—namely sulfur. So if birds don’t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn’t smell it.", "Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.", "But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air?", "As far as we could tell, this isn’t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab’s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart \"in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.\" He also said that he’s never personally noticed a bird fart.", "Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying \"excuse me\" after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird’s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed.

So I did. I pulled into the gas station, and then my wife brought the kid to the bathroom, and he announced that he was bluffing. He did NOT have to take a shit.

So I told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer. Begged him, really.", "Sponsored", "On the exit ramp, he suddenly stopped crying. And I knew why. I could hear him exhaling forcefully. Kids don’t hide that sort of thing. We pulled into the driveway (not before hitting every light on the way there), and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom. Green shit was CAKED on his legs. It was everywhere. Some of it fell out of his pants (how?) and landed on the front stoop. It was terrifying. Anyway, that’s parenting in a nutshell for you. You take every precaution possible, and you still end up with green shit all over the place.", "Now, your letters:", "Dan:", "I don’t know if this is a good question, because I doubt there’s any kind of satisfying answer to it. But why do no NFL teams seem to care that Jameis Winston maybe raped a girl? The mock drafts all have him going at no. 1 or 2 (most say no. 1). How the fuck?! Especially in light of the year the NFL has just had (and Goodell’s publicity push for an end to violence towards women), would it be that crazy to suggest that NFL teams won’t want to risk spending their first-round pick on someone who many people believe has a capacity for actual evil? Even if he never raped anyone, he has shown he’s a liability, at best, with the crab-legs thing and the \"fuck her right in the pussy\" thing. How are Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah not even hedging their bets at this stage? I’m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about Johnny Manziel’s partying and how that would affect his draft stock. HOW DOES RAPE NOT??? Why aren’t they even mentioning it?", "I think you’re wildly overgeneralizing to say teams don’t care. Of course they care. You’d care if you were the GM who decided to risk his job by investing the no. 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist. But the Bucs desperately need a QB (or else everyone gets fired anyway), so they’re probably best off drafting Winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to Peter King about how they had private eyes talk to over 75 people about Winston in studying him for the draft. That strikes me as an obvious ass-covering move so they can draft Winston, and then, if he fucks up, they can be like, \"Don’t blame us! We talked to 75 whole people about him!\" They just want to make sure he doesn’t commit any FUTURE rapes. And if he does, they want to make sure that they can blame Winston and Winston alone for it.", "But it is strange that, in the public scouting process, Winston’s past has been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemisms like \"immaturity\" and shit like that. Look at Lovie Smith gush about Winston, even though he can’t possibly know him all that well:", "\"To me, I think he’s told us an awful lot with how he’s handled it,\" Smith said. \"It’s not like he’s getting ready to go into the NFL and scrutiny is coming his way. He’s gone through it a couple years now, and he’s answered the bell. That’s what you have to do. You have to have tunnel vision and do your job. Looking from the outside, that’s what he’s been able to do.\"", "I mean, that’s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive. LOOK AT HIM SHAKE OFF DEFENDERS AND CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES WITH SUCH EASE! The fact that Winston was never formally charged with rape, and the fact that the NFL and their broadcast partners probably have a great many lawyers who would prefer that the word RAPE not be thrown around when addressing Winston, is all Smith needs to sell you on the IDEA of drafting him ... to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself as a way of cleverly masking the fact that the Bucs have an urgent, raw football need to fill, and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking Earth.", "That’s why Winston’s rape allegations haven’t necessarily affected his draft stock the way Johnny Manziel’s drinking did. It’s because NFL teams think that Winston is simply a better player. If neither player had baggage going into the draft, Winston would be taken before Manziel every time. That’s the reason the Browns are ready to give up on Manziel already. It’s not the boozing. It’s the fact that they don’t think the little fucker can play. The NFL can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing, but the bottom line is that the majority of their employees must win in order to keep their jobs, and that means they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the NFL would rather not acknowledge as still existing. They constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead. If Jameis is gonna go no. 1 no matter what, the NFL has no choice but to hold their noses and make it look like they didn’t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft.", "You know what’s funny about all this? Winston was AWFUL last season, and I’m not talking about just his \"Yakety Sax\" play in the Rose Bowl. He threw 18 picks last season against horrible, piddly-shit ACC teams. But scouts, for some reason, seem to be far more impressed by the fact that Winston staged a number of winning comebacks that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistakes. If you look the part, and you’ve got the arm, and you have that subjective mix of football IQ and magical QB unicorn leadership skills, scouts will happily overlook all those turnovers. And the rape stuff. It’s quite something.", "(By the way, SUPERFUCK Jaws and Mike Mayock for their little \"Mariota’s on top of my board now!\" spiel this week.

True story: In college, I would go to the dining hall, toast a bagel, grab a couple of hard-boiled eggs, remove the yolks, and then mush the whites onto the bagel and eat a sad egg-white bagel sandwich that way. I thought this was a healthy lunch, conveniently ignoring the whole \"eating a whole bagel\" part of the enterprise. Sometimes I ate two in one sitting. Do not do this.", "The truth is that egg whites are one of those foods you eat so that you can eat more food. I hate small portions, so if I eat a 12-pound egg-white omelet, I feel like I just got away with something. But in general, this is untrue. You need portion control in your life, which means you should just splurge and eat the goddamn yolk anyway. The yolk is the best part. All golden and runny and seeping into the toast nooks ... I could a 50-egg omelet. I swear. There are never enough eggs in the omelet for me. Why are eggs so small? I need eggs to be triple their current size. I don’t like cracking so many of them.

Even the nuttiest white-girl Beyoncé fans would get sick of her if she put out 120 songs a year. You can’t keep up with that kind of catalog. Those songs can’t all be great. Even if they were, you’d still grade them on a curve and have certain \"hits\" in your mind that would make your permanent rotation, with everything else falling by the wayside. That’s easy to do now. Back in day, when I had to listen to tapes, I usually listened to all the songs on the album because I was too lazy to fast forward.

Five of us were on a road trip from Montreal to Boston, rotating drivers evenly as one does on longish road trips. As we got close to Boston, the friend driving the last leg got pulled over for speeding. Since we were in college at the time, the $200+ ticket was nothing to sneeze at. (Who are we kidding? It’s still a lot of damn money.) The issue was — does the ticket get split amongst the group, or paid solely by the driver? The four of us who drove first say no, since we drove our portion without incident. The friend who got slapped with the bill argues that since the last leg was the toughest, and we were trying to get to our destination by a certain time, and nobody complained about his speed until the blue and whites started flashing, that we should split the ticket. Who is right?", "The last leg was the toughest? Why? Were there dragons lining the highway? Your friend was driving, and thus he’s responsible for his own driving behavior, even if he had shit luck. He pays the ticket. If another friend riding in the car wants to pitch in, fine. But that guy shouldn’t EXPECT it. These kids today never want to take responsibility SMDH!", "I went to a basketball game last week, and I had an Uber take me home, only the Uber guy got a parking ticket outside the arena while he was waiting for me. And I felt bad that he got the ticket, so when the ride ended, I gave him $20 in cash extra. And that, of course, made me feel all generous and kind.

While other women are more concerned with clothing and beauty, Belle’s nose is buried deep in a book -- and she’s not ashamed of it. In fact, in the film she even tries to teach another young girl how to read before being ridiculed by residents of the town for doing so.", "She held this impromptu lesson while doing her laundry. Rather than washing the clothes by hand, Belle attached a barrel to a mule and had the animal walk around in circles around a well, creating a washing machine, likely unseen before in the town.", "In the original \"Beauty and the Beast,\" the audience simply knows \"crazy Maurice\" (Kevin Kline) as a widower and Belle as his apparent caretaker. It was never clear who Belle’s mother was or what happened to her.", "But thanks to the remake, those questions have finally been answered. With a little help from a magical book -- courtesy of the enchantress who cursed him -- the Beast (Dan Stevens) and Belle travel back in time to Paris, where Belle was born. The pair are transported into a tiny, disheveled studio apartment with a view of a busy street. It’s \"much smaller\" than Belle imagined. It’s here the Beast tells Belle what happened to her mother.", "After spotting a doctor’s mask on the floor, the Beast concludes Belle’s mother died from the plague.

So he does, and the rest is history.", "The Beast was a rich prince, pompous and entitled -- but he wasn’t always that way.

The Beast lost his mother at a young age, and the castle staff said his cruel father kept him away from her while she was on her deathbed. Therefore, they feel responsible for his behavior, because they never \"protected\" him from his dad, who they say turned him into a \"Beast\" well before his physical transformation.", "It’s true.

The Beast is anything but bored with the books and agrees with Belle that his huge library really is wonderful. The Beast doesn’t need any help reading a book, and Belle even catches his reading a romance alone in the garden at one point.", "What happened to Mrs. Potts’ children, Chip’s brothers and sisters?

Gaston and LeFou exchange glances, implying that Maurice has lost it, and tell him it’s time to turn around. But Maurice refuses, explaining that they should head toward the right. Gaston loses his temper with Maurice and says he only entertained Maurice’s wild story because he wants to ask for his daughter’s hand in marriage. When Maurice says that will never happen, Gaston realizes Maurice will just get in his way, so he knocks him out and ties him to a tree, leaving him to the wolves.", "LeFou, clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leaving Maurice for dead, pleads with Gaston to reconsider, but Gaston pushes forward and returns to town without Maurice. Little does he know, Maurice will beat him back to town, telling locals the story about how Gaston left him there to die. If only they believed him...", "The live-action \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake made history by featuring Disney’s first-ever \"exclusively gay moment.\" In the new film, Josh Gad’s character, LeFou -- Gaston’s best friend and confidant -- was presented differently than the 1991 animated version.", "\"LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston,\" director Bill Condon told Attitude magazine. \"He’s confused about what he wants. It’s somebody who’s just realising that he has these feelings.\"", "At one point in the film, Gaston asks LeFou why he doesn’t have a lady. LeFou shrugs his shoulders and says he’s \"too clingy.\" At the end of the movie, LeFou is dancing at a big celebration inside the castle with Belle and the prince. He starts out dancing with a woman, but soon switches to partner with one of Gaston’s henchmen, who, earlier in the film, was pleased when the enchanted wardrobe dressed him in a puffy dress, wig and makeup.", "In the 1991 animated movie, the Beast has until his 21st birthday to break the curse. In the remake, there’s no set deadline -- he simply just has to find true love before \"the last petal falls,\" referring to the enchanted rose.", "And in the 2017 remake, that last petal does fall and the Beast -- who was shot by three bullets, rather than by arrows and a knife -- dies as Belle holds him in her arms on the balcony. At that moment, it appears the curse is final. Mrs. Potts, Chip, Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) slowly become inanimate objects and say their final goodbyes.

(Photo: Ron Jenkins/Getty Images)", "Last week, Kenneth W. Starr was stripped of his title as president of Baylor University after an independent investigation found that the university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against football players. Football head coach Art Briles was also fired as a result of the investigation. Starr, who will continue to serve as both chancellor and a law professor, gained notoriety as an independent counsel for his investigation of President Bill Clinton, the New York Times reports:", "Mr. Starr’s demotion delivered a twist to the biography of a man whose reputation was built on what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegations of sexual transgressions by Mr. Clinton. Now he is being punished for leading an administration that, according to a report from an ostensibly independent investigator, looked the other way when Baylor football players were accused of sex crimes, and sometimes convicted of them.", "The relationship between athletes and sexual assault is a decades-old discussion. Since at least the 1980s, high-profile rape cases involving famous athletes have led the press to speculate on whether players might be more prone to committing acts of sexual violence. A string of sexual assault allegations in recent years has ensured that college athletic programs and the athletes that populate them will remain in the spotlight. In the last two years alone, players from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, Florida State University, and the University of Oregon have made headlines for assault allegations. More than 160 higher education institutions are under investigation by the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights for sexual violence allegations. But are athletes actually more likely to commit sexual assaults, or are we just more likely to pay attention when they’re the ones accused of committing the crime?", "One factor to consider is that sexual violence does not occur in a vacuum. Anthropological research suggests that, rather than a purely psychological- or biological-driven act, sexual assaults are also highly influenced by culture. Peggy Sanday, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, found that some societies are more prone to rape than others; tribal societies with higher levels of male dominance, sex segregation, and tolerance of interpersonal violence had higher rates of rape. In other words, some environments can encourage sexual aggression.", "The recent investigation into Baylor concluded that university officials \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\"", "College athletics are highly sex segregated, extremely male dominated, and, at least in the case of some sports — football and hockey, for example — violent by design. While no university could be accused of explicitly encouraging sexual assault, several have been blamed for condoning such behaviors, or sweeping assault allegations under the rug. The recent investigation into Baylor, for example, concluded that university officials \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\"", "And the perceived lack of consequences for star athletes might embolden them to behave in sexually aggressive ways. Consider surveys that have found that between one in six and one in three men would be willing to \"use force\" to obtain sex from women as long as there were no consequences for their actions.", "While members of sports teams — and other male-dominated groups like fraternities and the military — are indeed more likely to commit gang rapes than the average person, there are few conclusive studies to show that athletes are more likely to commit sex crimes. There is some evidence that not all athletes are equally likely to be violent, according to Laura Finley, a sociologist at Barry University. Finley told Wisconsin Public Radio that players of \"power and performance sports\" — football, hockey, wrestling, and basketball — commit violent crimes more often that their peers in sports like swimming or tennis. An analysis of National Football League players by Benjamin Morris at FiveThirtyEight showed that, though the football stars displayed lower levels of domestic and sexual violence than the national average, the rate of domestic violence was still much higher than expected given their income bracket.", "Without better data, it’s hard to say anything definitive on the matter. Even the oft-cited statistic that one in three sexual assaults on college campuses are carried out by athletes dates back not to a scientific study, but to a 1986 Philadelphia Daily News article. (One 1995 study did, however, find that male athletes were overrepresented in reports of sexual assault on campuses.) Literature reviews, which are usually useful for identifying patterns in the sea of conflicting single studies that science produces, are also unreliable here: One recent review found that the bulk of research on the subject was inconclusive; another, however, found higher rates of violence among student athletes.", "We can at least say with certainty that universities have not been effective in handling the cases of sexual misconduct by athletes. A 2014 survey found that, in more than one-fifth of universities, the athletic department oversaw cases involving sexual assault allegations against athletes, prompting the National Collegiate Athletic Association to issue a resolution that athletic departments can only participate in, but never lead, investigations into such allegations.

PHOENIX — A single word — \"intentionally\" — could transform a court case against Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio from civil charges to a criminal prosecution.", "In finding Arpaio and three of his top commanders in contempt of court on Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow said no fewer than 19 times that the sheriff or his aides had repeatedly and intentionally violated judicial orders to stop profiling Latinos. On May 31, Snow will determine the civil penalties and examine whether Arpaio, the sheriff of Arizona’s Maricopa County, will be referred to Arizona’s U.S. attorney for potential criminal charges.", "Arpaio has acknowledged violating Snow’s order, but said it was a mistake. In weighing criminal charges, Snow must decide whether Arpaio’s violations of his orders were intentional.", "In the meantime, the judge had unusually harsh words for Arpaio.", "\"The Defendants’ unfair, partial, and inequitable application of discipline disproportionally (sic) damaged members of the Plaintiff class,\" Snow wrote.", "In a 2011 civil case brought by Latino drivers against Arpaio and his aides, Snow determined that Arpaio had encouraged his deputies to subject Latino drivers to greater scrutiny during traffic stops than white drivers typically received. He ordered the sheriff to put an end to the practice.", "Two years later, Snow found that Arpaio had continued the practice in violation of the order. At a Houston rally the next year, Arpaio told supporters that he had violated the order \"out of spite\" and had arrested 500 people.", "He later said in court filings that he had violated the order unknowingly.", "In Friday’s ruling, Arpaio was held in contempt on three counts. Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was found in contempt on two counts, and retired Chief Brian Sands and Lt. Joe Sousa each were found in contempt on one count.", "\"The Court finds that the Defendants have engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith,\" Snow wrote. \"In their testimony during the evidentiary hearing, Sheriff Arpaio and Chief Deputy Sheridan made multiple intentional misstatements of fact while under oath.\"", "In hearings last year, Arpaio, the octogenarian who calls himself \"America’s toughest sheriff,\" seemed to wither under questioning, particularly when asked about an effort he had made to investigate the judge.", "A lawyer for Arpaio had hired a private investigator to look into comments Snow’s wife purportedly made in a restaurant, where an informant claimed she had said the judge didn’t want to see Arpaio reelected.", "Arpaio apologized to Snow for the investigation, but the sheriff’s attorneys also used the incident to argue that Snow was no longer impartial and should recuse himself from the case. Snow declined.", "In his contempt ruling, Snow said Arpaio and his aides failed to turn over video evidence to plaintiffs in the civil case, disobeyed orders to gather evidence and continued to profile Latinos.", "Snow found that Arpaio hid thousands of pieces of evidence from the plaintiffs and deleted relevant digital evidence kept on hard drives.", "Longtime opponents immediately called for the sheriff to resign.", "\"Any public official who has been found guilty of racial profiling and ignores the orders of the court cannot be entrusted with the safety and well-being of the community and should step down in shame,\" the immigrant rights group Puente Arizona said in a statement Friday.", "The ACLU, which brought the original case against Arpaio, demanded stricter oversight and transparency from the sheriff’s office.", "\"Strong remedies are needed to protect the community’s rights, starting with internal investigations that root out and punish misconduct,\" said Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. \"Willing or not, the sheriff will be made to comply with the law.\"", "The ruling Friday was one of Arpaio’s most serious

{"uuid": "d381e9f6-1acd-4331-aa1b-a6a627d8ee03", "postId": "4qap0d", "postText": ["Scientists accidentally discover a new color, and it's beautiful!"], "postPlatform": "reddit", "targetParagraphs": ["Back in 2009, a lab full of chemists stumbled across a new pigment, more or less by sheer chance. After being heralded as \"the creation of a near-perfect blue pigment,\" this coincidental eureka moment is now being manufactured for artists’ brushes.", "This burst of blue came about when scientists at Oregon State University (OSU) heated manganese oxide, along with other chemicals, to over 1,200°C (2,000°F). Although the scientists were actually looking at manganese oxide for some of its electronic properties, one of their reactions inadvertently birthed a new pigment: the catchily named \"YInMn blue.\"", "The findings of the original study were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.", "\"Basically, this was an accidental discovery,\" said Mas Subramanian, a Milton Harris professor of materials science in the OSU Department of Chemistry, in a statement. \"Our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment.", "He added: \"Then one day a graduate student who is working on the project was taking samples out of a very hot furnace while I was walking by, and it was blue, a very beautiful blue. I realized immediately that something amazing had happened.\"", "So, what’s so special about this blue?", "This pigment is far more stable when exposed to heat or acidic conditions.

Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard/Bloomberg", "Method:", "1. Prepare the pie dough: I​n a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until it’s in coarse pieces about the size of peas. Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time and begin to gather the dough together with your hands. Pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick square and wrap in plastic to chill for a couple of hours in the fridge (or at least 30 minutes).", "2. Roast the squash: While the crust is chilling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Using a sharp knife, halve the squash and hollow out the seedy center with a spoon. Place squash cut sides up on a baking sheet and brush with butter. Bake for about one hour, or until the flesh is soft and cooked through. Once it's cooled, scoop out the flesh and add to a food processor with the pumpkin purée and mix until smooth. (If the squash is very wet, place in a cheesecloth and press to get rid of any excess moisture.) Set aside.", "3. Make the cardamom cream: I​n a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring cream and cardamom to a gentle simmer. Turn off heat, cover, and steep for 20 minutes. Strain and set aside to cool.", "4. Mix the filling: I​n a medium bowl, w​hisk together light brown sugar, spices, cornmeal, and salt. In another bowl, mix eggs with cardamom cream, squash, and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Slowly pour egg mixture into sugar mixture and whisk until combined.", "5. Prepare the pie crust: Flour your work surface and place the unwrapped dough in the center. Roll out, keeping it moving with your hands and throwing on more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have a disk of even thickness that’s about 12 inches in diameter. Invert your pie tin or dish onto the circle, and cut a circle that is about 1 to 2 ­inches larger than the tin. Place the folded dough into the pie tin and gently press it in. Roll up the extra dough hanging over the edge toward the center of the pie, creating a ring of dough, then crimp it all around. Put the crust in the freezer for at least 15 minutes.", "6. Blind bake the pie crust so that it holds its shape and is cooked through in the finished pie: P​reheat the oven to 425 degrees with a rack on the lowest level. Remove the pie crust from the freezer and place a square of aluminum foil over it. Fill with dried beans and place on baking sheet. Bake in oven for 15 minutes. Cool for 6 minutes, then carefully remove foil and beans. Turn heat down to 325 degrees.", "Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.", "7. Fill and finish the pie: Brush the crimped edges of pie crust with a little bit of egg wash, then spoon all of the tahini­-walnut paste onto the bottom of the crust and spread evenly (you can use your fingers to gently press it down). Pour the squash filling over the paste and carefully transfer back to oven. Bake pie for 40 minutes to 1 hour, until the edges are puffed up and the center is only slightly jiggly, then remove from oven and sprinkle lightly with sesame seeds. The pie should rest for at least 2 hours before slicing, and can also chill for a couple of hours in the fridge after it’s cooled if you like to serve it cold.", "Tejal Rao is the New York food critic for Bloomberg.
